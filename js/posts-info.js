    "description": "🐚Selfcare🐚\n\nIt's a hiding in bed kinda day! I love adventure and traveling and seeing new places, it fills me with inspiration and wonder. Art can touch me so deeply, it has a way of touching me to the core. Everything I see or do affects me on a deep level and it is such a full, vibrant life to live! The downside is that I get tired, very very tired. I need time to regroup from all the impressions, all that wonder, all that magic! So there are days I have to spend in bed, alone, to recharge, to take naps and read. To give all those impressions some space in my head and body, to let them settle in. #lifeofanintrovert #hsp #spendtimealone #recharge #alonetime #quiet #empath #hermit #balance #magic #wonder #books #gemstones #womenwhorunwiththewolves #downtime #sunday #journal #inhiding #tattoo #yogini #yin #witchesofinstagram",

    "description": "✨Everyday magic✨\n\nDoing the work isn't rocket science but it is definitely not easy. I've been diving deeper into meditation and manifestation practices and let me tell you, a lot of shit is coming up. \nIt can be so frustrating, having to drag through the same stuff over an over again but that's how it goes with patterns, they creep up on you. I'm noticing they are getting more nuanced, my issues are touching deeper to the core every time they come up, new lessons get integrated but at the same time the levels of hurt I access are much older, much more ingrained, much more painful. So I do the work, I sit, I try to be kind in myself, I read a lot and journal a lot and I grow a bit more every single time! 💕If anyone has any recommendations for support to help me through this a bit more easily, please feel free to share! I myself have been thinking about taking a few therapy sessions again since it has been a long time since I saw my psychologist. 💕#everydaymagic #meditation #manifestation #theuniversehasyourback #feelfreetoshare #adviceasked #doingthework #divingsdeeper #patterns #oldwounds #trauma #psychology #healing #inwaves #sittingwithit #pain #newlevels #growth #therapy #bodypositivity #stretchmarks #tigerstripes #wildwoman #witchesofinstagram",

Going to do some reiki now and also put an eye pillow on in order to cocoon and let go of all the impressions of today. #hsp #bunnynervoussystem #overstimulation #imput #desensitisation #mood #pms #hardday #ebbandflow #sensitivesoul #quiettime #earplugs #eyepillow #reiki #energyhealing #cocoon #energycircle #crystals #home #safespace #relax #witchesofinstagram",

I notice it creeping up on me when I see other people do great things and the first thing that pops up in my mind is not \"go you, that's awesome\" but \"does this make me less awesome then\". Ever since recovering from an eating disorder I decided to stop comparing myself to others, now the comparing seems to be creeping back but it's not just about looks anymore, it's about character and talents, and in my opinion that's even worse.\n________________\nI'm striving to be the kind of person that believes in abundance and not scarcity, I strive to be the kind of person that stands firmly into her self, that trusts her gut and her gifts. I'm only human so sometimes I fall into this trap of the mind and the ego but every time I catch myself more easily.

    "description": "The loss of stability and certainty scares us so much, I sure as hell know it scares me. But now that I'm in this place of everything is shifting and nothing is the same anymore, I also realise what a beautiful space it can be. It puts things in perspective, it brings calm where you wouldn't think you would find it.\n•\nIn the last week I resigned from my business, I rekindled an old business and gave it an update, we broke the lease on our house and searched for, found and signed for a new house in only two days time. Tomorrow we start moving and I have to say goodbye to this beautiful space we have here. •\nChange can be overwhelming and sad, but always trust that if you let go of one thing, the universe will send you something else in return. #change #lifeasitis #keepingitreal #flow #letgo #freefall #closeonedooropenanother #yogini #growth #movingout #movingon #nightsky #release #beautyinthestruggle #calm #zen #personal #witch #moonchild #theuniversehasyourback",

    "description": "Things are falling into place. A consult at my orthomolecular doctor showed that my adrenals are shot, no wonder really, which brings on a whole load of other issues, thyroid, menstrual etc. Finally I'm getting more insight in what is actually happening to me, why my body is reacting the way it does. I also got this book in the mail today, learning more about hormone balance is an amazing journey. I'll tell you guys more about the protocol I'm following to get my adrenals back into shape in one of the next posts! #healthupdate #hormonalhealth #wildwomen #sharemycycle #adrenalfatigue #orthomolecular #alternativemedicine #holistichealth #healing #balancingyourhormonesbalancingyourlife #claudiawelch #ayurveda #chinesemedicine",

    "description": "🌙Morning meditation🌙\nI've been learning how to live an awesome life because of my sensitivity, not in spite of it.\nI'm realising more and more what I do and do not want, what I do and do not need. I am become unapologetic about how I do things and why I do them. I am done conforming to the modern idea of success and even just life in general. •\n\nI don't want to live the kind of life where I have to take holidays to deal with the stress and exhaustion of the everyday. I don't want to live the kind of life where I put so much pressure on myself that I have to come home and hide in a blanket fort to be able to go through the same ordeal the next day. •\n\nI am creating a life for myself that makes it able for me to thrive, that makes everyday a moment to rest and heal, but also to share and teach and connect. I still don't know how all the practical things will unfold, but I can feel that I'm on to something, I'm on the right track. #wildempath #hsp #empath #sensitivesoul #sensitivityismystrenght #unapologetic #wildwoman #creation #consciousliving #awakening #yoga #lifeofanhsp #soulenterpreneur #lifeasitis #authenticity #sea #waves #nature #recharge #heal #adrenalfatigue #createyourownpath #growth #moonchild #witchesofinstagram",

Can't breathe, can't eat, can hardly even move. •\n\nI'm putting a lot of work into softening my pms and period symptoms but some months things get busy and life happens and before you know it you're hiding in bed for half of your cycle. It's frustrating but my body is a fragile thing and it's communication methods are quite efficient. • \nDon't let anyone ever tell you that this is \"normal\" though, if you suffer from pms and period pains, don't let doctors or friends or bosses tell you to take a painkiller and get on with it. We are not supposed to suffer like this, we are not supposed to hide our pain and grief. Find people who take your pain (both physical and mental) seriously and accept their support, but most of all, dare to stand up for yourself, dare to listen to your body, dare to heal and grow and shed and rest. #pms #wildempath #wildwoman #cyclesthatheal #femalemagic #sharemycycle #yourbodyknows #lifeasitis #uncensored #thegoodwiththebad #healing #menstrualawareness #authentic #trauma #hurt #wombwisdom #keepingitreal #witchesofinstagram",

I liked the design, it was up for grabs so I got it, I think I was in the tattoo shop to get it done in the same week I mailed I wanted it.\ni didn’t really think about it, there was no hidden meaning or story behind it, it was beautiful.\n______________\nIt turned out to be symbolic in more than one way though, when I see what happened this year, how I growed, how I changed and healed. My journey this year was being comfortable with being me, with showing my greatness, allowing myself to shine.

Turns out that what I want to do most is write, paint with words, untangle my mind and make space for new messy thoughts and dreams. #sharemycycle #follicularphase #ridingthewaves #flow #creation #femalemagic #cyclesthatheal #cycleawareness #cyclicalliving #consciousliving #makethings #write #reflection #goingwiththeflow #magic #hsp #meditation #wonder #wildwoman #witchesofinstagram",

    "description": "•magic•\n\nHow you see the world is going to reflect back to you. \n_\nThis is a practical kind of magic and it almost seems too simple, but at its core it is very hard. It asks you to become aware of your thought patterns and feelings. It brings you more control but with that it also brings you more responsibility. It is a daily practice, which means that you are going to fall and get up again more times then you can count. \n_\nSomewhere along the road, I somehow started to neglect this practice and this week I’m consciously picking it up again. \n_\n☁️Are you aware of the vibes you are sending out in the world?

I still feel the urge to hide but I am trying so hard to be open. \n_\nMy biggest fear, my biggest dark spot is the idea that I’m not good enough. That somehow I don’t deserve love and success. That I should stop pretending to deserve them. So this is the work I do, I breathe, I eat and I tell myself that I am good enough. Over and over. \n_\nAnd what I know now and didn’t know then, it’s not darkness that makes things bleak. Darkness is the soil for growth and depth and passion.

    "description": "• life of an introvert• \nI had the most exciting week with a new tattoo, a lot of new private clients, new business opportunities and very high vibes in general. And as it goes, at some point in the week I kind of crash and have to nap and recharge. Today is such a day. And that’s totally fine.\n_\nTake your time to slow down, especially when things are exciting and busy and awesome. You need downtime to wrap your head around things, to let your body ground, to let everything settle in. Some people need more of that than others. Listen to what your body and soul need from you, there’s no shame in slowing down and taking care of yourself! #littlereminder #selfcare #slowdown #hsp #lifeofanintrovert #introvert #recharge #downtime #takeallthetimeyouneed #balance #nap #sleep #yoga #meditation #quiet #honouryourneeds #mindbody #youareperfect #runningonhigh #consciousliving #catsofinstagram #catguru #theuniversehasyourback #selfcareisnotselfish",

    "description": "You know those moments when you feel like a fraud? When someone says something that upsets you so much and it makes you doubt everything you are doing? These are the times you want to lean in.\n_\nRemember that it’s not about the other person or about what you do, it is about how you feel about yourself. Why do you feel like you don’t deserve the job/the so/the friend/the success? Why does the situation trigger you? Things will keep pushing you in various ways until you have the courage to really look at them.\n_\nSo this is your cue, look at it, at that thing that has been bothering you, be kind, be soft but be real. Work with it so you can dive a bit deeper and lean in. #leanin #mirrors #patterns #growing #teatime #relfection #yogini #youareenough #triggers #bereal #besoft #knowyourself #youseethingsasyouare #mindgame #consciousliving #aloevera #psychology #inspiration #courage #keeplearning #lifelessons",

    "description": "My body has often been a source of pain instead of joy. Her story is riddled with eating disorders and menstrual issues and adrenal fatigue. Now, more than anything else, I seek to find joy in my body.\n_\nSo my yoga practice is therapy, it’s a discovery, it’s play. A quest for sensation, a quest for wonder, a quest for grounding. My meditation practice is a place for connection and acknowledgement. I walk to feel the wind in my hair, I move to feel the shift in my tissues, I eat to savour and nourish.\n_\nThis is what a practice and this is what i start sharing and teaching more and more. #embodiment #mindfulness #bodypositivity #mystory #bodylove #wonder #searchforjoy #joy #yoga #yogini #healing #eatingdisorder #pms #adrenalfatigue #loveyourbody #meditation #issuesinthetissues #holistichealth #yogatherapy #realstories #raw #dancerpose #balance #light #cracks #consciousliving #embodied #grounding",

    "description": "You always get to decide how you react to something, do you react out of fear or out of trust? \n_\nIt happens so fast, we fall into our old doubts and fears, we see scarcity instead of abundance, our ego pipes up and everything around is scares us shitless. Other people do amazing things and instead of feeling empowered and proud, we get insecure and petty. Good news is, it doesn’t have to be like this. You can be happy for them instead. (Mind blowing, I know)\n_\nRemember that nothing is yours, other people have ideas too, other people have talents too. You aren’t the only one on this road. Thank god right?! You are not alone. There are sisters out there carrying the burden with you, making the world a better place with you. \n_\nSo today I want to say that I’m grateful for all those people walking the same path. I’m proud of you for putting yourself out there and for doing amazing work. I’m grateful I don’t have to walk this road alone. I’m grateful for the fact that you make me think about what it is that I really want to do, about what my part in this is.\n_\n#tribe #onlyhuman #patterns #fearorfaith #yougettodecide #trustintheplan #youarenotalone #healers #onamission #consciousliving #yoga #raiseyourvibration #itsamindgame #intention #changingtheworld #sister #witches #spring #higherself #youareguided",

The thing is, they are just stories, things we tell ourselves, they are not the truth. \n_\nSo sometimes you have to challenges these stories even though your mind will tell you that is no use. For as long as I remember I believed in this idea that I am not creative. But I also always have wanted to make things, I want to be able to draw and paint, but I never do because I “know” I’m not good at it. Yesterday I bought myself paint and drew a mandala and spend hours drawing and painting just because I felt like it. I don’t know if it’s nice or pretty and frankly I don’t care. \n_\nWhat stories are you holding onto that you would rather change?

    "description": "As a sensitive person with a sensitive nervous system, part of my practice around boundaries is redefining “normal”. I remember the doctor saying I would recover in no time because I am a young and healthy individual. News flash, I am not recovering quickly - I might never recover as quickly as other people. And I’m okay with that. The hard thing is the expectation of “normal”, of people around you who are moving at a different pace. \n_\nSo I have to set firm boundaries: other people’s opinions about my recovery are none of my business, putting other people’s timeline on my body is not helping, pushing myself because I feel like I should is not healing.\n_\nEvery body is different. Read that again and let it sink in. Every. Body. Is. Different. So whenever you feel angry at your body, for not being normal, remember this, this is your pace, your body knows best.\n_\n#yourbodyknowsbest #hsp #sensitivenervoussystem #adrenalfatigue #spoonie #healing #thereisnowrongway #infection #boundaries #redefiningnormal #holistichealth #lifeofanhsp #bunnynervoussystem #recovery #grace #thebodyknows #selfcare",

Taking time to sit and breathe. \n_\nI used to think I had to do all these elaborate things to really have a great morning, at some point I did oil pulling, nauli kriya, meditation for 15 minutes and a yoga practice of about an hour. And I was convinced that my day would be crappy if I didn’t do all of that “correctly”. You see, all these tools are awesome, but when you use them as another way to stay in control, as another stick to beat yourself up with, they are not going to help you. \n_\nOver the years simplicity became my new go to. I like to keep my mornings simple and intuitive, we don’t always need the same thing so it would be strange to expect your self care tools to be the same every morning.

I’m learning to let go of that guilt every time I honour my boundaries and listen to my body.\n_\nToday I feel dizzy and tired and a bit broken. I preach self care and firm boundaries so I have to be the one that implements it for myself as well. And as much as I hate letting clients down, I hate it more to not be there for them fully and to tell them one thing and then do the opposite myself. You have to lead by example and today leading by example is sleeping and taking care of myself first.\n_\nI’m curious: do you feel guilty for cancelling appointment when you get sick? Do you ever take a mental health day? Would you rather see clients when you feel sick than cancel on them?\n_\n#practicewhatyoupreach #sickday #selfcare #boundaries #healing #yoga #lifeofayogateacher #lifeofayogatherapist #yogatherapy #soulfulentrepreneur #intuitivehealth #mindbody #balance #leadbyexample #takecareofyourselffirst #suptavirasana #gingertea",

    "description": "I got my first tarot deck when I was 17, just in college, and very confused about where I was going and why. I was ready for something, anything, to tell me what to do. I was willing to follow it blindly and mesmerised by the colours and stories.\n\n_\nThroughout the years I’ve always had a deck somewhere and I noticed that I mostly got it out when things where bad and I was out of options. On my knees, cornered, the images and their messages gave me a glimpse of hope,the idea that there was a big picture, even if I couldn’t see it at that moment. Some people pray when shit gets bad, I, apparently, get out a tarot deck.\n\n_\nThese last months I’m getting a new understanding of the tarot, it pops up in the podcasts I listen to and the books I read and slowly I’m learning more. In learning more about the origins, the cards and their stories I also realised that I’ve not given it the respect it deserves. Like anything, you cannot just use it as a Hail Mary and then abandon it when things get better, you cannot expect it to do the work for you, you have to work with it. It can be an amazing tool if you let it.\n_\n#tarot #selfdevelopment #mentalhealth #intuition #mindbody #holistichealth #storytelling #creatrix #ophidiarosatarot #alwaysastudent #empath #witchesofinstagram #thefool #altar #sacredspace",

And I remember thinking she was wrong, I was just a student, I didn’t have a job, how could I have a burn out?\n\n_\nOver these past years I learned that stress can come in many different forms and every body reacts to it differently, our nervous system can burn out in many ways. Sure our jobs can be big stressors, but so is our lifestyle or our emotional baggage or the fact that maybe we have chronic pain or inflammation. It’s time for us to look at stress in a different light, so we can take better care of ourselves and others.\n_\n#holistichealth #burnout #stress #mindbody #consciousliving #yogatherapy #antistress #selfcare #lifestyle #lifeofayogateacher #themoreyouknow #yogaasmedicine #holisticliving #slowdown #cyclicalliving #adrenalfatigue #adrenalhealthy #healthynervousystem",

    "description": "I notice around the holidays that it’s harder for me to not compare myself to others. I am such a romantic when it comes to Christmas, part of it is personality and part of it is because I want to believe in the dreamy vision of Christmas I see in movies and here on Instagram. \n_\nIn reality I’m down with a cold, I’m spending Christmas with just my boyfriend because my family situation is complicated and our Christmas Eve consisted of me dressing up and putting on lipstick, drinking one glass of champagne and then getting a fever, being grumpy, trying not to fall asleep because it’s Christmas and we are supposed to have fun.\n_\nWhy do I feel the need to share this? Because I have this feeling that I’m not alone in this, we all crave some magic and perfection from time to time and Christmas seems like the perfect time to create all that. So I’m inviting you to practice what I am practicing right now: I show myself grace for being hard on myself and comparing myself to others, we all have wounds and we all wish for things and that’s fine. I practice on finding beauty and gratitude in what is, right now, not in what could be or on what other people have. Where is the beauty in this moment, even if it isn’t perfect? How can I honour what is, right now?\n_\n#christmas #shadowwork #christmaslights #comparison #findgrace #gratitude #itsokaytonotbeokay #keepingitreal #open #authenticsharing #findbeauty #presence #beherenow #presenceoverperfect #gentlereminder #nowage #consciousliving",

    "description": "When we are on the brink of understanding or discovering something, the mind has a habit to keep us busy. Our brain doesn’t like change, it’s unsure, it’s unsafe, let’s stay where we are. So we know that we are on the brink of something big when our minds keep wandering, keep coming up with things to do, people to see, places to visit. One more errand, one more episode, one more story..\n_\nSo what do we do? We notice it, we sit with it. We tell our brain “thank you for your concern I know you are just trying to keep me safe but I’ve got this, we’ll be okay”. And then we stay, with the discomfort, with the thoughts, with the need to do, we stay with ourselves, and we grow a little more.\n_\n#mindgames #growth #ego #consciousliving #meditation #ritual #tarot #introspection #lifeofayogi #mindbody #yogatherapist #becoming #patterns #westay #findcomfortinthediscomfort #lightworker",

Take your time to put all your things back in their right spots and to find a nice space for anything you might have brought along.\n_\nAir. Open windows, let in fresh air, let the rooms breathe and maybe use a palo santo stick or some incense to cleanse and recharge to space.\n_\nTake up space. I love to spend time with my sacred spaces and set up new altars when I get home from a trip. Nurturing my plants and taking some time to dust, vacuum while organising things, it helps me to ground.\n_\nOthers things that really help me to get back into a rhythm when I get home is taking enough time off after a trip to wander around and get used to being home again, starting my first day home off with meditation and a nice, long bath 🛁 \n_\n#consciousliving #home #takeupspace #grounding #travelgram #homecoming #rituals #attuning #createspace #sacredspace #altar #selfcare #travelblues #yoga #holistichealth #air #recharge #ritualbath #hsp #highlysensitive",

I don’t have any epic plans, I don’t have any grand themes, any time I tried to come up with planning and manifesting I have just felt blocked and anxious. Today I was napping and drinking tea, writing, taking care of myself and I realise I do have a theme, a word for this year, I just had a lot of resistance against it. My theme is space. \n_\nI’m in hibernation and I don’t know when I’ll get out of it and it scares the go-getter in me. I’m used to wanting to create new and exciting things and grow my business and right now I just want to be alone, by myself, in the silence. More space, less doing. More space for me, less getting absorbed in my business and my everyday life. More space to discover who I am when everything falls away.\n_\nIt’s not epic or grand, it’s the exact opposite of it. I feel a lot of resistance about it because it’s not “how it’s supposed to go”. I feel like I should be growing my business, taking on new clients, creating new content.. But space it is, for now I will stay in hibernation and I’m going to stick with what I already here and use the rest of my time to focus on me, creating space.\n_\n#takingupspace #slowdown #selfcare #practicewhatyoupreach #smallbusinessowner #lightworker #enterpreneur #soulful #balance #lifeofayogatherapist #witchywoman #shadowwork #resistance #darkmoon #yoga #cyclicalliving #consciousliving #flow #hibernation #healing #theartistsway #creatrix #oracle",

    "description": "This morning in class I was talking about how our bodies react best to balance, how it feels safest to follow intense opening with a moment of contraction and softening. Contraction is a natural reaction to expansion, whether it’s in the body or the mind. Our systems focus on balance, balancing our extreme situations or feelings with a counterpoint. \n_\nI used to look at moments of contraction and falling back into old patterns as a sign of not being on the right track but now I know it’s exactly the opposite. If you come across resistance and contraction you are definitely on the right track. It’s a natural reaction from you body and your mind, trying to keep you safe, trying to keep you balanced. There is so much to learn in this space, not running away from the discomfort, not seeing it as a sign to go back to the old but instead learning to see it for what it is, the fact that you are outgrowing an old self, an old way of doing things.\n_\nAnd a special thanks to @wildsoulhealing for blowing my mind when I first heard her talk about contraction/expansion!\n_\n#leanin #contraction #balance #holistichealth #yogatherapy #mindbodysoul #growth #balance #expansion #cyclicalliving #consciousliving #yogini #lifeofayogi #findcomfortinthediscomfort #soften #lightworker #yin #yogaleuven",

You see, creating your own vision, being your own boss, it’s great in so many ways, it’s empowering, it’s wonderful and it’s also fucking scary and hard and confronting. \n_\nIt is what it is, eb and flow (also, I now know it has to do with #pms and not necessarily with what is actually happening) but I mostly feel the need to share this for all the other creators and visionaries out there, it’s okay to feel at a loss from time to time, we all go there. You are going to have moments like this, we all have them, they teach you where you are holding back, they teach you where you have got work to do. You are going to have moments like this, it does not mean that you aren’t doing what you are supposed to be doing. Please keep creating, please keep offering whatever it is you have to offer, we need voices like yours ✨\n_\n#intuitiveenterpreneur #cyclicalliving #smallbusinessowner #authenticity #yogatherapist #creatrix #visionary #lightworker #shareyourvoice #stopplayingsmall #lifeofanentrepreneur #yoga #witchwoman #pms #pmdd #goddessvibes",

I accept that the way my mind likes to plan my agenda isn’t always in sync with what my body needs.\n_\nSo I take the space I need, I breathe deeply, drink lavender tea. I work through my process first, the feelings of overwhelm, of too much, not enough. I know it’s for the best.

    "description": "Sometimes I get swept up in planning and what other people are doing and what my agenda is telling me I should be doing and it always ends in the same way: me, on the couch or in bed or hiding in some bathroom, in tears. this is a lesson I keep learning, planning is good but no plan can ever be more important than what your body is telling you. When I trust this I get everything done that I want to, in ways that are completely not how I planned them to be, when I sink in to what I need, more action, more rest, more alone time, more time to connect.. and I can let go of the idea that there should be a plan to follow somewhere, I can create magic, even as a highly sensitive person, even as an introvert, even as someone who’s adrenals aren’t always all too happy. \n_\n\nTrust me when I say that you don’t have to keep up with anyone, you can follow your own pace. everyone’s body is different, everyone’s nervous system is different, how you are feeling right now could be entirely different from how you will feel tomorrow. Stop thinking in terms of rules and should, make your own way. What do you need r i g h t  n o w. \n_\nWhat is your body telling you?

I just broke up with a long term boyfriend, didn’t know where I was going to live after I finished my studies that year, what I was going to do, didn’t know how to really be by myself anymore to be honest. So I booked plane tickets and went to Prague and it was both the most awful and beautiful experience. \n_\nI began really making a habit out of making trips by myself last year, my first full year of running my own business in my own home, acknowledging the need to be by myself to have a time out and be away from work. These trips are like a pause button, a moment to be away from everything and everyone and to notice where I am, where I want to go. Recalibrating and resting. Being with myself and listening to what my intuition is whispering to me.\n_\nDo you ever travel by yourself?

But it’s important, it’s important to do it, it’s important to talk about it because sometimes this is what the work looks like as well.

    "description": "Confession: sometimes I feel like a fraud. The last few weeks have been so rough on my body, fatigue, brain fog, mood swings, meltdowns and this afternoon the idea crept up in my head: why do you claim you can help people when there is so much “wrong” with you, how can you still be so broken when you do all the things, yoga, meditation, reiki, introspection..\n_\nOn my worst days, like today, I feel like a fraud, like I don’t have the right or the knowledge but then on my best days I know I can help people on a deeper way because I’ve been there, because sometimes I still am there, because healing is not a linear process and it takes time. Becoming is not a linear process and I have to remind myself that I’m allowed to be human.\n_\n#healing #adrenalfatigue #hsp #sensitive #bunnynervoussystem #confession #wildwoman #healingisspiralic #shadowwork #embodied #impostersyndrome #becoming #soften #gentlereminder #energyworker #yogatherapist #brainfog #lightlychildlightly",

I didn't have the energy to meet with all these people and network, I needed more time to recharge after meeting with clients, small things in my business could have a huge effect on my body + my mind. At first I thought I didnt \"business\" right, I just wasn't made for it, or I didn't have the stamina or the drive. I talked myself into thinking I didn't have what it takes.\n_\nThere was a huge shift when I started to do things my way, when I said no to all the social + networky things I felt I had to go to before, but invested in meaningful meetings + colabs, selected on gut feeling. When I stopped doing the things I though I was supposed to do (have 12 group classes, have 5 privates a day, have regular workshops on multiple locations.. the list goes on and on). I started to create a business that worked for me, one that supported me instead of me supporting it. There was a lot of learning + unlearning +figuring out + failing.\n_\n\nRight now my business is centred in selfcare, deep inner work and cyclical living + creating. ✨And I would love to start sharing my insights + rituals + tips + support with you. ✨\n\n_\n✨ Because I know there are people out there who feel like being self employed isnt for them but could thrive if they just found the right fit for them. I know there are people out there who have a big dream of a soulful business but are too afraid to act on it.

    "description": "When I was little I loved to read my horoscope in the magazines my mum bought, and I guess that love is still here now but it has transferred to monthly forecast podcasts and posts about the new and full moon. \n_\nI love to read forecasts for the new moon and the new month but at some point last year I realise I was listening to 5 podcasts + reading a hundred articles each month, picking up so many ideas from other people, some of them I wanted, some of them that didn’t really serve me. I stopped listening to my own knowledge and my own inner wisdom, I stopped drawing my own cards, I was giving away my power to someone else and somehow I stopped listening to the knowledge that was already inside me. \n_\nTo get back to myself I had to stop certain things, I stopped listening to monthly forecasts, I unfollowed people that talked about the moon + astrology on here, I started to connect back to what I felt about it, what I knew about it. Learning + unlearning. \n_\nAt this point I’m back to listening to the musings of a few of my favourite teachers and mentors, @wildsoulhealing ’s monthly medicine, @sarahmchappell ’s business forecast, @_ashleywood ’s  monthly forecast. I do only listen to them after I have done my own rituals, pulled my own tarot cards, tuned into my own intuition. So their views can enhance mine, not cloud them over.\n_\n📷 @withlovebyeva \n_\n#beyourownteacher #wildsoul #intuitiveliving #intuition #reconnection #reclaiming #wildwoman #guidance #oracle #tarot #consciousliving #energyworker #embodied #healing #horoscope #monthlymedicine",

I got to take charge of how I handled things, of how I felt about things, I got to take back my agency. Because I now know that things don’t happen to us.

But I also know I am growing and working though layers, and I know that I am supported, by lovely people around me and by myself.\n_\nMercury retrograde is notoriously a time for things coming back to find you + make you deal with them in ways you couldn’t before, is there something or someone that’s coming back for you right now?

    "description": "There is a specific moment in times of change, when you know you have outgrown something and you are ready to let it go, but you don’t know what’s going to come in it’s place yet. We all know that moment, an uncomfortable limbo, that place where your mind is all over the place and you want to hold on for just a bit longer because it’s so scary to let go and not know if something will catch your fall.\n_\nI’ve been writing + talking a lot about this exact moment because this is where the magic happens. This is where you grow, where you create, where you trust, where you heal ✨\n_\nAlso, this is not just something I talk about, this is something I try to invite into my life. A couple of months ago I drastically cut back my client load for yoga therapy sessions because I knew something else was ready to come in. I didn’t know what it was yet, and I was mostly doing yoga therapy work back then, so cutting back without knowing if anything else was going to come into its place was so very scary but also very necessary. I created space for all the exiting things I’m doing now, in those few months a started a podcast with my lovely soul sister @lanabauwens , I launched a Patreon account and I finally got to the point where I was ready to start mentoring people + allowing myself to take this next step in my growth. All of these things could not have happened without me creating space first, we always want to know what will come before we let go of the previous thing, but sometimes that’s just not how it works, sometimes there has to be space first before another thing can come in.\n_\n#creatingspace #growth #soulfulbusiness #intuitiveentrepreneur #mentor #wildwoman #takingtheleap #lettinggo #eclipseseason #youarenotlinear #becoming #witchy #evolution #allowyourselftobeseen #slowlife #tarot #eneryworker #leadbyexample #creatrix",

    "description": "Een lieve oproep van mezelf om selfcare te zien als meer dan maskertjes en bubbelbaden, begrijp me niet verkeerd, ik ben helemaal fan van een goed bad met veel bubbels en een maskertje op mijn snoet. Maar wat als selfcare ook de momenten zijn dat je zenuwstelsel in paniek schiet en je bij dat gevoel van angst kan blijven. Wanneer je niet uit bed raakt, laat staan uit je huis, maar toch je best doet om te zorgen dat je iets eet die dag. Wanneer zelfzorg grenzen stellen en nee zeggen is.\n\nWat als dat is waar zelfzorg voor jou om draait? zijn bij wat is, voor jezelf zorgen, hoe je je ook voelt. Je patronen en angsten en twijfels onder ogen zien en jezelf leren dat je veilig bent, ondersteund. Wat als we zelfzorg minder mooi maken, minder esthetisch verantwoord, maar functioneel? Wat als zelfzorg het meest radicale is dat je voor jezelf kan doen?\n_\n📷 @withlovebyeva \n_\n#radicalselfcare #selfcareisnotselfish #carryingourownweight #iamasafespace #creatingaspaceforyou #zelfzorg #shadowwork #trauma #embodied #soulcentred #soften #witchythings #selflove #lightworker",

    "description": "Het is op duizend verschillende manieren heel veel en heel snel en heel intens deze week. Shiften + groeien. Ik probeer te ademen en voor mezelf te zorgen, maar bij deze even een disclaimer dat het voor iedereen al wel eens teveel voelt en momenteel voelt het veel meer als dobberen dan als zwemmen. En das oké. Ik ben er zeker van dat het een heel waardevol proces is ook al kan ik nu nog niet helemaal zien hoe of wat en waarom.\n_\nDus ik maak een container voor mezelf en geef mezelf de tijd om dingen te verwerken, een plekje te zoeken voor alle emoties en angsten en jullie er ook even aan te herinneren, I’m right there with you. Groeien stopt nooit, veranderingen blijven komen en patronen blijven ambetant.\n_\nps: mijn grenzen zijn heel stevig nu dus ik kies er ook bewust voor om sommige afspraken te verplaatsen, sommige mailtjes even te laten liggen en sommige dingen niet te zeggen of te tonen, dat is niet om vaag te zijn, dat is omdat het even het beste voelt zo.\n_\n#growthisnotlineair #themoon #scorpio #whathealinglookslike #shadowwork #inthearena #selfcare #boundaries #soften #crackedopen #waxingmoon #moonchild #wildwoman #bunnynervoussytem #hsp #empath #portals #lettinggo #dealingwithchange #medicineforthesensitivesoul #iamsupported #iamenough #queenofcups",

    "description": "In mijn sessies zeg ik vaak dat de dingen die we doen eigenlijk oefenmomenten zijn voor het echte leven.\n\nWe zitten op onze yoga mat en maken contact met ons lichaam zodat we het makkelijker kunnen voelen in momenten van stress, zodat we beter kunnen leren luisteren wat het nodig heeft. We doen dagelijks rituelen zodat we een houvast hebben, een ritme, niet voor de momenten waarop alles goed gaat maar voor de momenten waarop niets nog duidelijk en zeker is. We leren om voor onszelf te zorgen, door het iedere dag een beetje te doen, en we starten wanneer het “makkelijk” is. Niet omdat bij jezelf zijn en contact maken met jezelf ooit makkelijk is, maar omdat er momenten in je leven gaan zijn waarop het onmogelijk lijkt, en we er ook dan voor willen zorgen dat we er kunnen zijn, bij alles wat is. \n_\n📷 @withlovebyeva \n_\n#selfcare #selfcareforasensitivenervoussystem #whywepractice #everydayrituals #yogatherapy #shadowwork #yogaasalifestyle #reconnect #soften #learningtogrow #growthisnotlinear #wildwoman #reiki #energywork #rituallife #consciousliving #sacredspace #iamasafespace #grounding #embodied #lunarliving #intuitiveliving",

    "description": "Ik betrap mezelf erop dat ik bepaalde momenten liever niet deel tegenwoordig. Soms om gegronde redenen, omdat ik er eerst het inner work nog rond moet doen of omdat het gewoon persoonlijk is. Soms omdat ik niet wil zagen, niet teveel wil zijn, niet wil tonen dat ik ook struggle (of zoals mijn hoofd fluistert “nog altijd struggle”).\n_\nIk vind het moeilijk om bepaalde momenten te delen nu omdat ze heel kwetsbaar zijn en ze me heel kwetsbaar doen voelen, omdat alles momenteel voelt als overleven en niets nog stevig voelt en mijn zenuwstelsel daar niet mee om kan. En tegelijk is het ook zo belangrijk dat ik dit wel deel, want het leven is niet altijd mooi en duidelijk en in balans. En dit zijn de momenten waar we groeien en leren. En ik ben aan het leren om mezelf te tonen, ongeacht of het mooi of inspirerend is.\n_\nDit ben ik die ruimte opneemt, en dingen toont ondanks dat er weerstand is om teveel of te weinig of te.. gevonden te worden. Omdat ik weet dat ze waardevol zijn voor anderen en omdat ik er vast van overtuigd ben dat de wereld nood heeft aan meer ruimte voor groeimomenten, want die zijn niet alleen mooi maar ook gewoon verschrikkelijk pijnlijk soms.\n_\n#shadowwork #healingshame #iamenough #growthisnotlinear #healing #yogatherapy #wildwoman #keepingitreal #boundaries #selfcare #witchywoman #moonchild #thestar #growingpains #expansion #learninglessons #takingupspace",

    "description": "De laatste dagen zijn een les geweest in ruimte maken wanneer het aanvoelt alsof er geen ruimte is. In momenten van stilte inbouwen in chaos, in werken met wat er is, niet wat ik zou willen dat er is.\n_\nWanneer stabiliteit wegvalt heb ik nogal de neiging om te gaan overleven en mijn adem in te houden totdat alles terug oké is. Op zich helemaal niets mis mee, maar je kan natuurlijk maar zolang je adem inhouden voordat je terug boven water moet komen. Dus ik ga op zoek naar kleine landingsmomentjes, een beetje stilte in de chaos, een beetje opladen in het overleven. Het leven gebeurt niet alleen in de momenten dat alles loopt zoals we willen, maar ook (en vooral) in al die momenten errond. En ik denk dat ik stilletjes leer om daar ook bij te zijn, om daar ook echt aanwezig te zijn, en niet vooral te zitten wachten totdat het voorbij is.\n_\n#softenintochange #growthisnotlinear #growingpains #selfcare #nervoussystemcare #survivalmode #soulful #consciousliving #shadowwork #wildwoman #creatingspace #breakup #becoming #beingwithwhatis #iamasafespace #gentlereminder #iamenough #home #thisiswheregrowthhappens #expansion",

    "description": "s h a d o w w o r k\n\nVandaag moest ik denken aan hoe vaak het woord “gevoelig” als een verwijt of een aanval tegen me gebruikt werd, en hoelang dat ook zo voelde. Alsof dat mijn zwakke punt was, mijn valkuil, het ding waar andere mensen me op kunnen pakken. En hoe ik duizend kleine en grote momenten nodig gehad heb om er vrede mee te krijgen, dat gevoelig zijn. En hoe ik nu oprecht kan zeggen dat het mijn grootste kracht is.\n_\nHet besef dat woorden pas een invloed op je hebben, pas macht over je hebben, als je ze niet volledig kan toelaten en kan ownen. Woorden hebben pas een invloed als je ergens het gevoel hebt dat je het niet zou moeten zijn of dat je anders zou kunnen zijn, als je zelf niet helemaal oké bent met dat aspect van jezelf. Welk woord heeft jou nog in zijn macht?\n_\n#shadowwork #gevoelig #hsp #sensitive #takingupspace #shadow #growth #embodiment #wildwoman #innerwork #sacredspace #witchywoman #owningwhoyouare #gentemreminder #softenintochange #changemaker #sensitivesoul",

    "description": "Loslaten is geen groots moment waarop je iets neerzet en het nooit meer oppakt. Loslaten gebeurt in laagjes. Beetje bij beetje, kleine stukjes afpellen die je kan laten gaan. Beetje bij beetje vrede vinden in wat is (ook als is dat niet wat je zou willen wat er is). Met iedere stap die je zet, beseffen dat je vooruit gaat, wegloopt bij dat gene dat je achterlaat.\n_\nLoslaten is leren dat je oké bent zo, dat het oké is om sommige stukjes nog niet te kunnen laten gaan en anderen wel. Vandaag ben ik het een beetje beu, het hele proces, en wou ik dat ik al aan de andere kant was. Dat ik er alleen de wijze lessen van overhield en niet de onzekerheid en het harde werk en de pieken + dalen. Maar zoals dat gaat met een proces duurt dat al vaak wat langer dan ons hoofd zou denken dat het gaat, dus ik neem de tijd en stroom mee op de golven van loslaten en vasthouden, van oké zijn en niet oké zijn. \n_\n#loslaten #lettinggo #innerwork #healingisntlinear #shadowwork #gentlereminder #whereyouareisperfect #beingokaywithnotbeingokay #witchywoman #autumn #wildsoul",

Hoe meer ik loslaat, hoe meer er naar me toekomt. \n_\n\nLaagjes en lessen die telkens dieper binnenkomen, die telkens echter worden. Laagjes die ik van me af pel, en hoe meer ik loslaat, hoe meer flow en magie er komt. Het voelt alsof alles hier al een tijdje zat te wachten tot ik eindelijk zou gaan verzachten, echt zou gaan verzachten, niet alleen het soort dat mooi is op foto, maar het soort dat zo oncomfortabel en messy is dat je voelt alsof je in stukjes breekt. Ik leer eindelijk dat ik echt mag stilstaan en dat de wereld dan niet gaat stilvallen, dat hier mijn kracht ligt, dat het belangrijkste dat ik op dit moment kan doen is om aan mezelf te werken, te graven, te zitten in het donker en zien wat daar ligt.\n_\n#moonmusings #gentlereminder #shadowwork #newmoonscorpio #lettinggo #phoenix #authenticliving #soften #verzachten #witchythings #oracle #wildwoman #soulful #lunarliving #moonchild #authenticity #magic #flow #healing #sheddingskin #scorpio #rebirth #journal #intuitivewriting",

Ruimte maken voor stilte, ruimte maken zodat dingen naar ons toe kunnen komen in plaats van er achteraan te gaan. \n_\n#intuitiveliving #slowlife #intuitie #ruimtemaken #slowingdown #winter #mantra #quote #creatingspace #cylicalliving #deeprest #selfcare #radicalrest #soften #gentlereminder",

    "description": "Je bent op dit moment exact waar je moet zijn.\n\nIk hoor dat altijd, ik zeg dat veel tegen mensen, ik lees erover en tegelijk voel ik het niet. Tegelijk WIL ik hier niet zijn, in de messy inbetween, de momenten die inspirerend zijn om naderhand over te lezen en over te vertellen, de momenten waar alles shift als je er later op terugkijkt. Maar als je erin zit voelt het als één langgerekte chaos, als iets waar je zo snel mogelijk wil uitkrabbelen. Als je erin zit, voelt het alsof je er niet zou mogen zijn, want onze “slechte” momenten krijgen toch pas hun waarde in het moment achteraf, wanneer we er iets goed over kunnen zeggen? (spoiler alert: they don’t)\n\n_\nIk ben op dit moment exact waar ik moet zijn, niet omdat ik er volgend jaar een mooi verhaal over ga kunnen vertellen of omdat het straks vast wel “beter” wordt. Ik ben exact waar ik moet zijn omdat ik hier ben, in de rommel en de chaos en het niet weten. Dit is geen wachtruimte, dit is geen moment waar ik door moet om aan de andere kant te komen, dit moment is even waardevol als alle andere momenten in het leven, het zit gewoon in een verpakking die mensen oncomfortabel maakt.\n_\n#consciousliving #growingpains #shadowwork #catsofinstagram #healingisntlinear #theinbetween #witchywoman #wildwoman #soulfulliving #trustyourintuition #moonchild #nervoussystemcare #selfcare",

    "description": "☾ eclips musings ☾\n\nIk heb me nog nooit zoveel en zo weinig mezelf gevoeld.\n\nIk was deze ochtend aan het babbelen met een vriendin over de bizarre tijd waar we in zitten, over de intensiteit van de energie en de laatste lessen van 2019 en het moment tussen de eclipsen in. En ik stuurde haar “ik heb me nog nooit zoveel en zo weinig mezelf gevoeld” en ik wist dat het vaag was maar ook dat ze het zou begrijpen en hetzelfde zou voelen. Dat het klopt. Het voelt alsof alles zweeft en tijdloos is, het voelt alsof er belangrijke dingen aan het gebeuren zijn, hier, in het alledaagse. Het voelt als een radicale verschuiving, alsof de dingen die we nu leren een bodem gaan vormen voor iets groter, iets anders. \n_\nIk ben de laatste weken super veel aan het doorkrijgen, ideetjes, inzichten, guidance op een andere manier dan ik het gewend ben. Kleine en grote zetjes, fluisteringen. Het idee van ruimte innemen blijft terug komen, loslaten om te kunnen groeien, gronden om te kunnen channelen. \n_\nIk heb me nog nooit zoveel en zo weinig mezelf gevoeld. Ik heb nog nooit zoveel chaos en zoveel rust tegelijk gevoeld. Er was nog nooit zoveel groei en zoveel loslaten tegelijk. ☾\n\nHet is een super krachtige tijd om stil te staan, om te letten op de dingen die je aandacht willen en je af te vragen wat je dit jaar geleerd hebt, hoe je gegroeid bent, welke dingen je mag gaan loslaten?\n_\n#eclipseseason #moonmusings #oracle #sacredspace #intuitiveguidance #intuitiveliving #moonchild #wildwoman #witchesofinstagram #witchythings #growth #grounding #takingupspace #softenintochange #becoming",

Maar zo werkt het niet, dingen leren of afleren gebeurd vaak in stukjes, eb en vloed, op en af. En als we het dan terug “slecht” doen, of het moeilijk hebben, is het zo makkelijk om te geloven dat we niet vooruit aan het gaan zijn.\n_\nMaar wat als dat net betekend dat we wel vooruit gaan, wat als groeien nu eenmaal zo werkt, in stukjes, op en af. Met makkelijk en moeilijke momenten. Met een hoofd en een zenuwstelsel dat oude patronen gebruikt omdat dat net de dingen zijn die ze kennen. Wat als de “slechte” momenten er eigenlijk zijn om te tonen dat we iets belangrijk aan het doen zijn, dat we lessen aan het leren zijn, en dat dat oncomfortabel is, maar ook gewoon de enige manier om het te doen.\n_\nVertrouw erop dat je vooruit aan het gaan bent, ookal voelt het soms alsof je stil staat 💕\n_\n#growthisnotlineair #healing #groeien #nervoussystemcare #selfcare #spiritualliving #womenwhorunwiththewolves #moonchild #wildwoman #thisiswhathealinglookslike #maanmagie #lunarliving #intuitie #hsp #zelfontwikkeling #gentlereminder #zelfzorg #selfcare",

    "description": "“we are giving you all this time, will you choose to fill it with noise or will you surrender”\n\ndat, al dagen, on repeat, van mijn guides, het komt op de gekste momenten door. en ook, overal eksters, overal vlinders, over veertjes.\n\nhet heeft me een paar dagen van laagjes en denken dat ik aan het loslaten was geduurd om nu echt te verzachten. En niet meer zo hard te trekken en sleuren aan alles, aan een tarot cursus die er wel wil komen, maar nu nog niet, aan online sessies aanbieden en ze promoten maar tegelijk bijna een paniekaanval krijgen als mensen ze boeken. Ik zie zoveel mensen rondom me zalig meestromen op deze vibe en mooie dingen maken en doen, maar bij mij lukt het momenteel niet. \n_\nwaarom niet? omdat dat niet mijn manier van zijn en creëren is, ik heb ruimte nodig en inzichten, geen druk want ik heb geleerd dat dat voor mij niet werkt. omdat mijn guides en tarot kaarten me de hele tijd aanmanen om stil te staan en los te laten, dat het nog niet de moment is, dat ik nog niet alles kan zien. omdat ik momenteel al mijn energie mag steken in ademen en mijn zenuwstelsel kalmeren en overleven, en dat dat ook helemaal oke is.\n_\nje mag jezelf blijven, ook in deze tijd, je mag je eigen ding blijven doen, op je eigen manier. tis niet omdat iedereen nu een online cursus maakt, of zweeds leert, of vrijwilligerswerk doet, dat jij dat ook moet doet. misschien is jouw ding nu wel even dutjes doen, voor jezelf zorgen, fijne energie naar mensen sturen, leren loslaten.. _\n#surrender #loslaten #intuitiveliving #minderdoenmagook #slowlife #soften #receicingmode #iamprovidedfor #gentlereminder #selfcare #nervoussystemcare #youaredoingokay #kitten #catsofinstagram #release #yin #intuitive #hsp #empath #water",

    "description": "lieve heksen\n\ntis met veel droefheid, maar ook veel trots voor het afgelopen jaar, dat ik jullie kom vertellen dat ik er niet bij zal zijn voor het vervolg van het @heksendragensneakers avontuur.\n\nomdat ik ruimte moet maken nu voor lessen en projecten die willen doorkomen, omdat het voorbije jaar super geweldig was en ik dat gevoel wil behouden, omdat jullie echtheid en authenticiteit en een goed voorbeeld verdienen, iemand die practised wat ze preached, en dat is dit: weten wanneer je iets moet loslaten voor jezelf, omdat je intuïtie het vraagt, en voor anderen, omdat zij de beste versie van iets magisch verdienen.\n\ndankjulliewel voor dit mooie, geweldige, hartverwarmende jaar. om mee te volgen en te luisteren en berichtjes te sturen en te delen waar jullie onze podcast mee naar toe namen. dankjulliewel voor jullie verhalen van groei en inzichten en herkenning en moeilijke en mooie momenten. dankjullie om de beste heksen ooit te zijn + dankje aan Lana om mijn witchy partner in crime te zijn \nheel veel liefs + keep spreading your magic,\n\nMaxime \n_\n📷 @leentjeloveslight",

    "description": "i’m in the middle of this exquisite magical painful birthing process and i can feel the discomfort humming in my bones\n\nit feels like the past year (or maybe even years) all I’ve been doing is excavating, diving deep, coming closer, healing layers.. and every time i think i might be done for a while, a new layer comes up, like ripples in the water, waves crashing over me\n\ni know a lot of you have been feeling it too, i notice it in the message I get that ask me when it will get softer and i have two answers to that\n\nit will get softer when it does. so simple, so annoying. it will get softer when you soften, when you learn to surrender\n\nwhich brings me to my second answer, it wont, at least not when you are asking me when we will stop transforming and learning and feeling. this is what being human feels like, and sometimes its devastating and sometimes is beautiful but there’s always always growth and change, that’s what we are here to do, to learn. It will get softer when you embrace that, when you learn that the waves will come and go like the tide but that they are supposed to, and that you have a choice here, to brace yourself or to flow. and that we will have to learn this with every single turn again, to soften, to trust. \n\n_\n#embodiment #becoming #soften #change #transformation #rebirth #oracle #channel #surrender #verzachten #healing #moonchild #waterkind #thisiswhatgrowthlookslike #intuition #soulfullife #followyourtuition #youareguided",

    "description": "so often it feels like we are only doing inner work when we are busy doing something, when we have this plan to focus on a part of ourself and use tools and document it, see the progress. yet some of the most profound work i have done this year has been in the days stuck in bed, when i was too sick to even sit upright without support, when couldn’t think clear enough to write down what parts of myself that were coming up. just because you aren’t actively doing things, doesn’t mean you are not shifting and growing\n\nrest is a valid part of this process and one we often overlook\n\nwhat does your inner work look like when you can’t write or read? what does your inner work look like when your body is forcing you to go slower? when a lot of the processes are happening under the radar, while you rest, while you heal, while things shift for you?\n_\n#innerwork #spiritualworkisbodywork #embodied #growth #chronicillness #migraine #slowlife #healing #water #feelitall #becoming #slower #softer #moonchild #oracle #nervoussystemsupport #hsp #rest",

    "description": "the truth is i haven’t been doing so well the last couple of weeks (or even months). it started with pain meds for migraines and my body completely freaking out on them. and wanting to be better soon, and working on “fixing it” and rationalising the amount of time it would take to heal.\n\nit started with one doctor after the other not really knowing what it was or how to help, or even implying that i should just make more of an effort. with ER visits and blood tests and various types of meds and still being in pain every day \n\nall of this to say that i’m quite at the end of my strengths at the moment, both physically and emotionally. and that i’m not looking for advice i just want to keep you guys in the loop and be as open and honest as possible here. \n\ni notice how instagram isn’t feeling nourishing for me right now, how i feel a lot of pressure to create and do and be better already, how i get upset or angry being on here (and i definitely don’t want to be that kind of person) so i’ve decided to take some distance here. i only want to show up here when i actually have the energetic capacity to hold you guys and share, not because i feel like i have to for engagement. there won’t be any offerings in october either, i really have to focus on getting better first.",

    "description": "every year of our lives is ruled by a tarot card and this year, for me, strength popped up. i’ve thought a lot about her this year, what strength means to me, what layers of her i didn’t expect. with every twist and turn of my life this year, it just strikes me how wildly appropriate she is as my space holder and also how immensely euphemistic it all seems. \n\nstrength sounds like some hardship, like learning to be brave, it doesn’t sound like surviving things you never imagined you could survive\n\nthis past month ive done things i’d never thought i could carry. things i screamed were too hard for me to make it through, and still i always did. i’m not saying this because i’m brave.\n\nI feel frail, broken, lost, overcome. \n\ni say this because we can do more than we think, more than we ever should be able to handle. because when you’re at that point where the only option is carrying the heavy thing, we do it without giving it a second thought. there simply is no option of not doing it. we carry it with something primal and ancient and resilient inside of us. this doesn’t mean that it’s not too hard, it means that it can be too hard and you can still do it, all at the same time\n_\n#enbodiedtarot #soullife #healing #becoming #strenght #doingthethings #hope #intuitivetarot #creatrix #oracle #witchythings #musings",

    "description": "recovery diaries #1\n\nhere i am, i’ve just turned 29. i’ve been vegan for 5 years, i do yoga, go out for walks . i’m careful about hormones and bpa and quit the pill a few years ago. i drink nettle tea and kombucha, infuse what i eat and drink with reiki. i’ve worked on my trauma and my life is cyclical and listen to my intuition.\n\ni also have cancer\n\nand the feeling of “this is so unfair” keeps sneaking in more and more. i did everything right. this was supposed to give me some kind of edge, some kind of controle, some kind of protective bubble. and now i’m learning to be with that feeling. how we create this sense of safety and controle for ourselves and what we do when it crumbles \n\nthe physical healing is the hardest i’ve ever had to do, but the emotional is as well. the trauma of feeling so betrayed by your body, the trauma of hospitals and treatments, that the thing that is going to heal you will also break down so much of you. it’s the little things that make me the saddest, losing my cycle and how silly that seems compared to everything. how foreign my body feels with everything rearranged. i’ve lost so much weight i cant regulate my own body temperature and i think about my eating disorder days and how silly it was of me wanting to disappear and take up less space while my body is fighting so hard now to take up more. every day is a struggle and mostly it still feels like me against my body but the moments i can feel her again and realise it’s actually her that’s fighting as well, trying so hard as well, are becoming more frequent. i chant to her like a little kid, that i’m sorry i’m not patient with her and i know it’s hard and she’s trying.\n\nthis is what healing is, the messy in between, it’s okay to be here. this needs space as well, the hurting, the survival, the grief, the anger. this is what being brave is, it’s how we keep going every day, it’s how we try to smile when we’d rather cry yes, but also it’s creating space for every aspect of the experience. we need to feel this to make space, we need to go through this to move further.\n_\n#recoverydiaries #cancer #tw #eatingdisorder #healing #becoming #freefall #thefool #embodied",

    "description": "gut feeling\n\ni had this feeling, like a screeching sound in my mind i couldn’t get rid off entirely. a feeling that something bad was up. i had it in summer and i had it last week. of course when you get diagnosed with cancer it’s very hard to figure out whether that feeling is plain old fear, or trauma, or intuition. but the feeling was there and so was the pain. \n\ni remember telling a friend a few days before the ERvisit that something was up, not okay. calling it a gut feeling is deeply ironic because of course that’s the place of all my not okayness.\n\nturns out my intuition keeps calling all the things before the doctors find them and my body knows. cancers back, 2 months after clear scans, under chemo, way too soon, way too aggressive, and i’m the odd one out yet again.\n\nwe named him this time, and we know his deal, he has a dna thing we are going to try to take advantage of (his name is fritz btw, the dna thing is called BRAF but i wouldn’t google that because it will not make you incredibly happy)\n\nso here we go again, against all odds. trusting gut feelings and ironically it feels better than it has before, it can see something i can’t yet (or it’s just coping, who will tell).\n_\nalso a gentle reminder that i’m not a fighter or brave, just someone whose been dealt a crappy hand and is playing the hell out of it\n_\n#gutfeeling #intuition #feelitall #cancerdiaries #moonchild #thebodyknows #healingjourney #returnofthefritz #brafmutation",

    "description": "the dark moon has always been my companion, diving deep into her whispering magic of softness + beauty in the mess + the unknown. she travels with me, keeps me company in so many ways while i’m in my own dark moon stages.\n\nive been thinking about death a lot, not in a scary or alarming way, she is just with me in what i do. her presence has become more apparent. of course she is always there, even when we try so hard to believe that life is the only side of the coin we will know. how beautifully naive we are, how hardbreakingly stubborn. \n\nsometimes i think it would be easier if we learned to live with death before we really have to, learned to talk about her. i’m inviting her into my life now, into the good and the bad moments, she’s here with me, like the dark moon, giving things a new shape, a new flavour. i’m learning to not be afraid of her, to talk about her, not in whispers but with ease, with love and softness and sadness. she closer than she has ever been and that’s okay because she is not really that scary. she’s part of the eb and flow, just like the moon.\n_\n#cancerdiaries #living #death #embodiedtarot #darkmoon #moonchild #softness #sacredspace #tarot #intuitiveliving",

    "description": "i miss work so much. the creative flow of things, connecting to people, spending all days with my cards and magical tools, flowing. i derive(d) a huge part of my identity from what i do and right now that is nothing and it makes me feel like i am missing a huge piece of me.\n\nit doesn’t help that my inspiration and channel are still picking up on things so there are quite a few things that i had to let go of because i couldn’t hold space for them or give them enough space to grow. an awesome, magical group program was hanging in the air for all of last summer and i knew that for some reason i had to wait for october to launch it but i was already deep in the creative process of it until i got to sick to work and by the time it was october i learned that it wasn’t a practical thing that had to click before i could start but that i had to let it go completely as it got diagnosed. the idea for a podcast has been hanging around since last summer as well, it took on many shapes and forms, i recorded a couple of trailers for it and now it seems to be in hibernation.\n\ni love the ideas that come to visit but it also hurts so much to not be able to dive into them, i’m honouring that and softening in that and hope that some next idea might be something i can actually physically birth as well\n_\n#grief #whatcancerlookslike #creatrix #sacredspace #witchythings #altar #tarot #intuitivetarot #soften #healing #smoke #release",

    "description": "incurable \n\nwe had only just settled into the waiting room, months of these appointments and we learned that the oncology waiting room is kind of a limbo and a marathon all in one. so i was joking with the oncologist about how this was the shortest wait ever as we walked in because i get super chatty when i’m nervous and he asked me how i’m doing and i politely answer while all we really want to do is skip this part and hear about the scans.\n\neverything is stable, you are doing so great\n\nand it’s the first time that i want to ask the question, that i really want to know. previous appointments i dogged it and didn’t want to hear the specifics, reading between the lines was heartbreaking enough.\n\n“so is this still curative treatment or how would we describe this dance we are doing?”\n\nhe takes a breath and looks into my eyes and tries to formulate a few different answers at the same time. we already knew it, in a way, we already felt it but it’s the first time that someone actually says it out loud\n\nincurable \n\nthe treatment i’m on right now won’t cure me and they can’t operate and we don’t really have other options. but as long as i stay stable and the meds keep working and i can handle the side effects this is what it is. chronic cancer, or whatever we want to call this option. we don’t really talk or hear about this side of cancer a lot but the group of people like me is getting bigger every day. the group that isn’t dying but also will never be cured. we are living in a limbo of our own\n_\n#thisiswharcancerlookslike #braf #coloncancer #incurablecancer #immunotherapy #soften #embodied #healthupdate #chronicillness #underworldjourney #thevoid #limbo",

    "description": "reclaiming. becoming. rebirthing\n\ni remind myself that this is a life worth living. it is my mantra, a continuous echo in the hollow of my spine, on the days when i feel like i’m crawling and scratching and barely hanging on, on the days when the light and the softness of my sweater and your voice is so unbearably beautiful. \n\nthis is a life. it’s worth living. it beats in my chest and it surges through my veins. \n\nit is\nit has to be\ni am creating it\n\ni write about all the parts of myself i am missing and how i might invite them back. i miss having a body that has more space, that has room for creation and processes and magic. that isn’t consumed by pain or fatigue or worry. i invite in pieces of my core self through music and the lens of my camera and the rhythm of my words. i wear lipstick and skirts and bask in the sun and call it worship. sometimes i dream i am already dead and i am transformed and another version of me again.\n\nbringing back and letting go. shedding layer after layer after layer and discovering that what is left is always the same and always completely different. i am me. at the core i always am and will be and no experience can take that away.\n\nthis is a life worth living and i want to life it through all of its incarnations\n_\njournal musings from this afternoon, sitting in the sun on my favourite bench, photo 4-5 are early 2020 versions of me\n_\n#musings #journal #mantra #soften #becoming #incarnation #creatrix #moonchild #cyclicalliving #grievingpastselves #soul #livinginthevoid #thecrone #blooming #embodiedtarot #rebirth #phoenix #reclamation #lifewithcancer",

    "description": "what a cycle in my life looks like right now\n\nit starts after an oncology visit where you hear about the results of the scan you had last week. from then on the clock starts ticking (hopefully), 3 months. first there is a couple of weeks of decompression, the trauma, all the mental steps of grief and f*ck and “i have cancer?!” the last part keeps coming up even if you’ve had cancer for decades, there is always the small moment of disbelief that this is really your life now. then come the good months, where you have built up the courage and decided this is a life that is worth living and you will live every breath of it. there are treatments and prayers and sometimes a hospital and/or ER visit. life is good but there is a little thing in the back, hiding behind everything, always there to remind you. then the next scans are planned and depending on who you are and how you cope the days/weeks before scan start to escalate your mental state again and then there is all the waiting and the scan itself and then the worst of all, the waiting between the scan and the oncology appointment. \n\nrinse and repeat, as many cycles as you are lucky enough to get. cyclical living in the medical system, the ebb and flow of the chronically ill\n_\nmusings written while i was waiting for my scan last week and felt important to share as i’m hearing the results tomorrow \n\n#whatcancerlookslike #bowelcancer #stage4needsmore #braf",

    "description": "years ago i was planning on adopting an older tomcat to give him a nice home to spend his senior days in and then, while visiting the shelter, baby Snow crawled into my lap, started purring and she looked into my eyes like she had known me my whole life. long story short, i planned to adopt a black, senior tomcat and i actually got adopted by two white girl kittens and i never regretted it one moment. to this day Snow still crawls into my lap and looks into my soul, because of course we were always meant to be in each other’s lives.\n\n#soulmate #adoptdontshop #howmycatadoptedme",

    "description": "𓊓 selfcare as a portal 𓊓\n\nfor a while after i heard “incurable” i dropped all my selfcare practises. what’s the point right? if nothing can actually save you. if there isn’t anything that can cure you, what is it all for then, really?\n\nmy selfcare toolbox is filled to the brim from my time as a therapist and a body worker and a yoga teacher and an energy worker and a human roaming this earth. but it had taken me until now to discover its real purpose, its real definition.\n\nselfcare isn’t about saving ourselves, about becoming these perfect beings, curing every single thing that crosses our path. \n\nselfcare is an anchor\n\na way to make sure we can live in the softest possible way. the million little things we can do for ourselves to make days just that little bit easier. an empowerment tool that helps us take controle back over our bodies and minds. it’s the things we can do to live with the things we can cure.\n\ntoday is the day after my immuno therapy and iron infusion and selfcare consists of hydration and self soothing. my lovely kine helped bring some space in my sacrum and lower back, in this video i’m stretching after she left, sipping on cacao and hibiscus, wearing a golden face mask, softening. i might still feel crappy and have side effects but i am making it as easy and safe as possible for me. \n\ni’m writing in my journal, the way my selfcare practises now are cyclical and intuitive and whole. there’s the whisper of a book about this, sharing what i know, both the tools and the philosophy. i’m excited to get started on it, but first let’s take a nap.\n\n#selfcare #nervoussystemcare #embodied #thisiswhatcancerlookslike",

    "description": "when i first got diagnosed i swore i wouldn’t become “that” cancer patient. i didn’t want to be just a patient, to have cancer be the main theme in my life. i remember telling someone a few days after that cancer was the least interesting thing about me and i still think that is true.i think back to that time and how privileged i was to have never experienced something so all consuming, not being able to imagine that there were things that could strip you of your whole identity. what a blessing to not know how some things just turn you inside out, leave you completely stripped bare.\n\nliving with cancer has taught me that, in my case, there is no way of living life like it’s not there. cancer is always here, walking along side me. somedays it’s peacefully walking next to me, gently brushing past my hands. others days it drags me back with all its might and i have to use all my strength to even stay upright. i’m never not a cancer patient, but i’m also always more than that.\n\ni think this is a lesson we only learn when we live with something that sweeps every layer from under our feet. it’s not to say that i didn’t know about those things at all before, i knew what it was to live with trauma and chronic illness, i had made it my live’s work to support people emotionally, physically and spiritually who knew this as their reality as well. i knew rock bottom and hardship and growth, but at every point of those situation i also was solid in my identity. i was sick but there was always more, and the more always outweighed the sickness. i couldn’t imagine the all consumingness of an incurable illness yet. \n\ni was afraid to lose my independence and my identity. and in a way i lost them both but i also kind of got them back. \n\ni’m learning that there is life here, in the void, on the ground floor, at the bottom of the well. there is more than cancer here, but there will never be no cancer.\n_\n#musings #lifewithcancer #thisiswhatcancerlookslike #chronicillness #internalisedableism #healing #soften #becoming #thereislifehere #livinginthevoid #darkmoonvibes #embodied #emodiedtarot #towermoments #rockbottom #intuitiveliving",

    "description": "my body continues to amaze me, i’m in awe of her, in all her brokenness, how resilient she is, how much she wants to heal. i can feel her pulse, her eagerness. she wants to be worked with, is so receptive to the help of my lovely therapists and the heat lamp and the meds and the movement and the inner work and the herbs. \n\nagain there is a shift, this ever changing landscape of life and illness. new lessons and new rituals and new challenges. it surprises me that i even thought being ill would be one thing, maybe because i never was sick longterm before this. i never realised that illness had its own rhythms and cycles and cyclicality. i was afraid i had lost that, my shape shifting, cyclic, moonchild ways, it’s the first thing i grieved when i found out i had cancer. and now i’m learning, everytime in new ways, that it’s not gone, just changed. \n\nevery phase comes with a new way of life. i’m not the old maxime from before, but i’m also not the sick person from last year, not even like i used to be some months ago. so i’m navigating again, the things i can and cannot do, the things that call me and light me up. it’s always finding a balance between movement and stillness. the call to create is getting more urgent. the call to connect and be in stillness, to channel and tune in. \n\nmy body continues to amaze me, more than ever she is my compass, leading the way to new versions of me\n\n_\n#thisiswharcancerlookslike #embodied #bodyneutrality #ostomate #stoma #bowelcancer #braf #stage4needsmore #incurableillness #chronicillness #moonchild #cyclicalliving #healing #soften #selfportrait #selfcare",

    "description": "one of the themes that is really highlighted for me this eclipse season is the need/urge/importance to walk my own path \n\never since getting sick i’ve been learning to take care of me, to use my tools and talents on me, to make my selfcare my priority. that’s not to say that i didn’t take care of myself before but it was more transactional, i did it so i could take care of others, so i could be a grounded and well rounded therapist and oracle and mentor. the focus was on others, on making myself as useful as possible, a vessel. and then i couldn’t do that anymore and found that i myself was in such need of some of that energy i had been putting in everything else\n\neclipses bring up themes that have been living in our bodies and minds and lives already. it might feel like it is, but it’s never an out of the blue thunderstrike, it’s always something that has been brewing and now gets some accelerated energy love to help move it forward in ways that we couldn’t\n\nso here i am, mulling over patterns that have been a year and a half in the making. wondering about why i do the things i do. the importance of slow life and selfcare growing ever more anchored, not just juicy phrases and half lived truths, necessity\n\nan example that seems very superficial but has been helping me a lot is my annoyance with the algorithm, engagement and views and followers tanking, before as a business owner it would have been hard but now it’s hard too and i’m trying to figure out why. would i still be doing these things if no one saw or liked them? do i solely derive my worth from this? would i change what i’m doing if it meant better numbers? why do i ever look at the number to begin with? is it important because i realise this is the thing i will leave behind?(and a side note to this, we are all just human, of course we like to be liked and of course these kind of things will sting, no judgment)\n\nit feels like a new layer in doing for me, creating because i want to. letting go of what the response to it is.\n\ni also added photographer to my bio, you know because that is mostly what i am\n_\n#eclipseseason #shadowwork #lessonslearned #becoming #transformation #oracle #moonchild",

    "description": "i did a story archive time travel a couple of mornings ago while i was lying on the couch with a hot water bottle waiting for pain meds to kick in at 5 in the morning. it seemed like a logical activity and a side note is that your story archive here on insta is the most fun diary and i highly recommend building one for yourself, you will not regret it\n\nback to the time travel, it’s so important for me to look into those flashbacks because i tend to forget how far i’ve actually come. it’s interesting to see me using the same phrases i use right now, i talk about immuno therapy being okay, especially after being on chemo for months, how grateful i am for being able to do more things and also how annoyed i get when there’s a set back. the phrases are the same, the reality isn’t. last year versus now is day and night. i’ve been getting so much stronger and can do so much more and it is crucial for me to take time to recognise that, to celebrate it.\n\nthis becomes even more important on the hard days, to see how far i’ve come, to know that i can still bounce back and grow. to trust that this is the ebb and flow of my life now and that i am resilient. to continue learning that a few bad days do not make a bad life. so today i look back and i’m in awe of the person i was a year ago and the person i am now, i take the time to celebrate how far i’ve come. a year ago it seemed like a dream to ever be able to do the things i can do now\n_\npic 2: archive from may 2021 || pic 3-7: may 2021 || pic 8-10: this week\n_\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #thereislifehere #growth #healing #embodiment #reflection #innerwork #soften #selfcare #nervoussystemhealth #celebrate #silverlinings #cyclicalliving #slowlife #moonchild",

    "description": "here’s a little secret that has been weighing me down: i’m not an inspirational sick person\n\nthis afternoon i sat on the couch crying because i got sooo jealous of my husband living a normal life. for weeks already it’s been hard for me to keep up with friends, even those people that hold a special place in my heart and i love like i love nothing else. i can’t deal with the mundane of other peoples’ lives, i don’t have the patience to listen and smile and be polite. i can’t be happy about others success, seeing them do things i can’t do\n\ni thought being sick was something i would get used to, would get better at. thing is, it’s not. it’s a struggle, an uphill battle and my energy is being depleted more and more. i thought things would take less energy but they don’t. my baseline is just overwhelmed at all times. i’m not a good person or a saint or an inspiration\n\ni retreat and i snap and i cry and i communicate honestly and try to make myself feel as safe as possible, try to recharge and put up boundaries. mostly working on dealing with how disappointed that makes me feel in myself, how ashamed i feel for not being able to be there for others, for not being more patient or gracious \n\ni never wanted to become this person but circumstances have made me like this. i think it’s important to show this side as well exactly because i’m so ashamed. i only ever saw images/heard stories  of sick people carrying it with grace and love and sparkle, being so kind and open for everyone and it is making me feel like a failure even though i know better. even though i know about ableism and inspiration p*rn and trauma. even though i know there is nothing wrong with my reaction and it’s okay to have to take a step back. there is still shame here, for not dealing with this better. \n\nso i’m sharing my little secret with you, partly as healing for myself and partly as a way to bring different stories out there. i’m not an inspirational sick person, and i’m learning that i don’t have to be \n_\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #chronicalillness #embodied #mentalhealth #selfcare #photography #selfportrait #healing #soften #thevoid  #inspirational #ableism #bowelcancer #brafmutation",

    "description": "i’m restless and unsettled,half asleep/half awake on a plane flying back to normal life in belgium. full moon glimmers mixed with post travel blues and the timeless void that we find ourselves in on airports and planes. there are all these whispers and ideas. impressions from the trip that are working their way through all of my layers. memories and treasures and photographs. a dozen of writings in my notes app, from whole stories to string of words. the idea and the feeling of birth is very present. not just a new project (or maybe projects?)that are slowly finding there shape and mood but also the notion that i have touched a part of me that was dormant.\n\ni keep feeling more and more like myself, inching my way back to myself. not maxime from before, even though it feels like a phoenix experience more than a caterpillar one. i don’t belief that there is a way back to that, the old version of yourself, nor do i think there should be, we are meant to move forward not back. it’s a new version that is grounded in an old one, foundations that help me feel solid and safe and like me. pieces of myself that have been lost for the longest time that are now reanimated. \n\na spiritual part of me, a cyclical part of me, a channeling part of me. \nsolid. spacious. supported.\n\nthis trip was a reclamation in a lot of ways, a gentle reacquaintance. it awakened the flame of a vision of myself i can’t wait to flesh out more. embracing this egyptian goddess/water nymph/ forest fairy incarnation i tapped into. curious to discover what kind of creations she is planning on bringing earthside\n\n_\npicture 1 from our cyprus trip reminded me of a similar picture (nr2) we took in malta at hagar qim in 2018\n_\n#islandlife #travelgram #ancient #fullmoonvibes #creatrix #manifestation #cyprus #soften #become #embodied #egyptianvibes #tombofkings #historicsites #ancientmagic #oracle #magpie #sacredspace #ritual #driedflowers #thisiswhatcancerlookslike #forestfairy #reclamation",

    "description": "getting back to normal life has been hard for me. i hear every one around me and all their plans, summer festivals and holidays and life in general, all the people i know seem to be pregnant, starting businesses, writing books. and here i am, getting back to normal life means getting back to being incurably ill. for about 10 days i had myself convinced i could live a “normal” life, granted one with extra naps and antibiotics and pills that are keeping me alive, but still a life without hospital and doctors, where no one knew i had cancer. i went to visit ancient sites and walked around in my swimming suit all day, hair wet with pool water or sea salt, watching sun sets on cliffs, going on all kinds of adventures. and then i came back and the day after that i went to the hospital to get an infusion and got into a traumatic situation and i was very much here again. in a life that feels like a stalemate, seeing everyone growing and living and planning while i’m wondering if that was the last holiday i’m ever able to go on\n\ni’m not ready to be back here, im grieving all the versions of me that could have been. i’m tired of being sick, being in treatment, being reduced to this and still there is no other way. for now i’m allowing myself to feel it all, to grieve and reel. to feel so alone in all this. for now i’m getting used to being here again. being here still. \n_\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #chronicillness #stage4needsmore #coloncancer #braf #treatmentfatigue #medicaltrauma #incurablyill #becoming #livingwithcancer #grief",

    "description": "and all of a sudden \nthere is  s p a c e  again\n\ncyprus came with a great shift for me, an insight into who i am and how i want to live life, what i want to create. a glimpse into the bigger picture, a piece of the puzzle. this energy and its effects were still present for me on the plane, in sync with the whispers of the full moon. it was chaotic, ideas, phrases, images, half dreams, notions. seedlings still taking shape, mid creation, half written, half formed but so clearly there. it was rippling, making waves, tumbling into my energy and embodiment and vision\n\nand then there was nothing.\na block. a cloud in front of the sun. eclipse.\noverwhelm and grief and physical pain and fatigue. a blank. i lost connection to all of those electric vibes and shifts and they were somehow lost at sea or maybe it was me who was lost in the waves. this is part of the process as well, it’s our body protecting us when it’s too much and energy going first to recuperation and rest and healing. it’s part of integration and life and growth\n\nthis morning i sat outside with a cup of coffee and i started writing and slowly it started becoming clear again. like the clouds had parted. the waters became clear again. \ni could see it, waiting for me at the bottom of the ocean. as soon as i could see/feel it there, it shifted, there was space again.  i felt connected, to myself and the ideas and the dreams. since this morning my pain had also significantly easier, take from that what you want\n\nit feels like i can breathe again and today’s care taking was diving to the bottom of the lake and coming back with pieces of treasure. drying my hair on the rocks and napping and feeling and writing. i wrote 6pages, dense, close blocks of text, words of sorrow and feelings and joy and ideas and insights\n\n#soften #embodied #upgrades #oracle #thisiswhatcancerlookslike",

    "description": "i have a tendency to grasp for controle and structure when i get overwhelmed. i don’t think im alone in that, it’s a human thing, we want to have something to hold on to, something that is reliable, something we can get a handle on, especially when all the other things in our lives feel like chaos and struggle\n\nso in times of shifts and void times, i always notice how the need for structure comes up. i want to make lists and create a plan, have a schedule, plan in rituals and creative times and what to read and what to do when i get a panic attack. (i literally used to have this every time during my pms time when i still had a cycle) i know where it comes from and i know what it looks like because i’ve been doing it since as long as i can remember. it’s kind of nice because when i get like “i want to make a plan to do daily body work and have to start doing something useful with my time” i know i am feeling very unsafe and out in the open. i’ve been working on and around this pattern for ages and when it came up again today i drew some cards about it and it became very clear that i am ready to let go of the pattern. it has served it’s time as a coping mechanism and then it has served it’s time as a kind of sign that showed me i wanted to use a coping mechanism and now it felt like something out of another life time and i am ready to let go. (also a little add on that there is nothing wrong with coping mechanisms at all, sometimes you just outgrow them and they aren’t really necessary anymore)\n\ni just spent some time standing with my feet in the grass, the last sunlight warming my body, hands on my belly. i feel sleepy in a good way, after a day with sun and writing and insights, the way you get sleepy when someone has worked on your back and diaphragm. the way you get sleepy when you have decided to stop holding on because everything that could possible fall apart has already hit the ground and maybe now it is finally the time to relax and soften into that\n\n#darkmoon #endingcycles #letgo #embodied #thisiswhatcancerlookslike",

    "description": "gentle reminder that there doesn’t have to be a silver lining. you don’t have to learn lessons or come out on the other side stronger/better/softer. sometimes a process is just a process. sometimes a situation just s*cks. some seasons are just filled with love and grief and drowning and not much more. we can try to make the best of it or we can’t, both are valid and reasonable options\n\ni’m sick of explaining to people that good days in my world would be horrible in a healthy person’s universe. that taking care of myself is a full time job and sometimes i do it with love and gusto and sometimes i just go through the motions and sometimes i don’t even do it at all. that it is heartbreaking to live in a body that feels like the most unsafe space you could possibly be in \n\nthis week i’m frazzled and anxious, rock bottom, in a loop of fear and hope. i take care of myself as best as i can and try to be as soft as possible. i’m journaling underneath the big walnut tree, sitting with the sun on my face and listening to the birds. there are some insights here about embodiment and safety. about being in a body and lessons i’ve learned and patterns i am ready to look closer at. it’s not meaning per se, it doesn’t make it all worthwhile, but it is progress and it is a balm. i move my body, bare feet in the grass. stretching whatever felt tight (my scar acts up when the weather is fickle and my diaphragm feels very stuck). of course it’s a cycle when i’m anxious and my body feels stuck and my breathing becomes shallow and that in turn makes me more anxious. i focus on lymph movement because i’ve noticed that helps\n\nit has a familiarity and a desperation to it, these cycles of ebb and flow. living life in the void. \nthis is selfcare as a necessity, it’s an anchor, a ladder, a shout in the void. it’s intuitive and hands-in-the-mud-messy. it doesn’t make it better but it makes it tolerable. it gives me the idea that there are still some things that are in my controle. it’s a curated safe space that i can breathe into\n\n_\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #stage4needsmore #bowelcancer #incurablyill #embodied #sunsoaking #livinginasickbody #rebellioushope #livingdespiteitall #braf",

    "description": "my altar had been feeling wrong for some time now but i didn’t know how to begin shifting things so i didn’t. it is summer and the garden is my altar in a way now so it’s okay but i did miss the sacredness and silence of it, a dedicated space of beauty and connection and safety.\n\nand then today i spent some time inside and i just had to move things, had to shift the energy. it makes total sense for me that it is only after it feels like i made some shifts and changes and clicks internally that i can bring them into the world. so i played with smoke and all of my treasures and sang along to music. i cried when the song came on that reminded me of her. i breathed and put my hand on my chest. i drank tea and danced and created.",

    "description": "i feel exhausted, but in a peaceful way, after a night of nightmares and waking up early with pain in my back and tummy, connective tissue and scar tissue and pressure. this afternoon i have to be at the hospital to meet with my oncologist and discuss last weeks’ scans. im dreading it, the cold, artificially lit up waiting rooms where everyone is a least double my age. the waiting. the polite talks with the assistent before we talk about the scans. i want to be here, in the garden in the sunshine. and i remind myself that right now i am. sitting in my favourite spot with a mug of tea and a mug of coffee. sitting. writing. reading. bram has installed his home office under our patio and it makes me feel safe in ways i can’t explain. how he know that right now i mostly need company and he made sure he was working from home today so he could be close whenever i needed to drop by for a chat or a question or a hug. people i know well and less well send me messages and tell me they are burning candles for me and it warms my heart.\n\nthis is the centre of the void. even while living in the void there are periods that feel more stable and steady and others that feel like being on open sea. sitting in that waiting room of the oncology department feels like the actual manifestation of what the void is and feels like. \n\ni catch myself thinking that  i should be doing all these things right now, with the possibility of earth shattering change so viscerally present. that i should make this moment worthwhile. i remind myself that i don’t have to listen to that, that just sitting here is enough, being is enough. i remind myself that i have been on this point, or a variation of it, a lot of times already the past couple of years and it continues to blow my mind, but it also comforts me\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #embodied #livinginthevoid",

    "description": "i believe in magic\n\nmore specifically i believe that we are all here to bring our specific kind of magic into this world, the kind that only you possess \n\nthat lingers on your fingertips and words and lungs, that weaves all the wonders and pain you ever experienced together, that fills your heart and soul and radiates out from you\n\ni believe that this kind of magic is born from all the parts of us, from the voids we waded through and the sunlight we drank in. from the tears we shed and the moments our heart was touched, in sad ways and in beautiful ways\n\nit’s exactly because we are whole and complex and f’d up that we are pure magic. it’s exactly because of all of our parts that we touch others\n\nknow this, wherever you are right now, it is forming you, it is transforming you, it is shaping you in ways that will allow you to be more solid and soft and magical \n\n#gentlereminder",

    "description": "≘ here’s your gentle reminder that processing big things often looks very boring ≘\n\nit doesn’t matter if your big thing is something physical or mental or emotional or energetic, whether it’s something “good” or “bad”. these things take time to settle, our bodies and minds and systems need time to calibrate and incorporate what happened\n\nthis is the parts they don’t show in movies, or they do it in a quirky montage with upbeat music to signify the passage of time. this is the part they gloss over in stories because we all want to hear the about the actual miracle but not the hard work in the mud and the silence that comes before it, the months of mundane eat/sleep/repeat. processing is very much the part we would rather skip over, especially in our quick win/instant gratification culture, this is the part where it seems/feels like nothing is happening while actually it ALL is happening in this space, in the openness, the vastness, the void. planting the seed is actually the easy part, all the energy and work and hope comes in the part after, where something is working to create a flower and let her bloom.\n\nso here’s an example of what my processing looks at the moment. there has been some very big energetic shifts with some huge insights happening for me this week and i am so excited for everything to come together and to share the stories that will emerge from here but i also think it is very important to share what this in between space is looking like for me right now because this is where all the magic is actually happening and it’s the part we often don’t really see.\nprocessing right now looks like sleeping a lot, 12hr nights and naps in the morning and the afternoon. it looks like spending my days in pjs, reading books, a mix of memoirs and poetry and novels i am reading for the 5th time. watching reality tv, selling the oc just came out and it feels like perfect timing. all of these things are helping me create space, an opening to feel and heal and process.",

    "description": "≘ tarot musings from the void ≘ full moon in pisces \n\n≘\nit feels a bit weightless right about now, like everything is shifting and up in the air and not quite sure if and where it will land yet. as it usually goes when i ask my guides and tarot cards about it i don’t really get a solid answer about the why and the how’s and the when’s of it but there is this sweet musings that will help us soften into what is, whatever that might be right now\n\n≘ channeled message from my guides || tarot card musing from page of cups ≘\n\nnow is the time to dream, to let yourself flow on the weightlessness of it all. it’s normal to want to know what will happen and when and why but just trust that those are not things you are meant to know right now, trust that everything is happening and shifting and that it will with or without your interference. \n\nwhat to do then? soften. enjoy this moment as it is. the electric feel of everything that is open and possible. the possibility that comes when things come to a close. the space we are granted when no new things have come in the place yet\n\nwe are in the void right now, in the veil. as a collective and in our personal lives, in the energy and the season and the shifts everywhere\n\nthis is a blank space, what do you want to fill it with? what better way to discover then to dream\n\nthis is a moment to really be open and aware to your dreams, night and day dreams alike. what whispers are coming to you when you are sound asleep? take notice of signs and colours and what if feels like. what whispers are coming to you when you are gazing out the window, letting your mind wander? now is the time for old dreams to resurface, dreams you might have buried some time ago that are now ready to be planted and grow. timing is a tricky and magical thing and sometimes it doesn’t work the first time around so don’t listen to your mind too much when it has something to say about “how that didn’t work for us the first time  #tarotmusingsfromthevoid #moonmedicine #soften",

    "description": "about love and living in the moment and nourishment \n\ni’m writing this with my face in the sun next to a gorgeous pool somewhere in the gorgeousness of france. one of the first things i said when my scans turned out a bit wonky last month is that we had to squeeze in a holiday somewhere in september, there are so many things i still want to see and experience and we don’t know what the next scans will say and how it will be if i have to go on a different treatment (and if i will even be able to) so the pressure felt very real. this is one of the things that are hardest on me, knowing that at one point i will not be able to do the things i can today, that there are some trips i will never be able to make, at some point travel will no longer be an option for me..\n\nturns out it is kind of hard to plan a last minute vacation when your husband’s busiest month at work is september. travel as an incurably ill person is always difficult, the top things i still want to see i am not cleared for by my medical team (egypt and joshua tree are a bit tricky to go to when your cancer might be active again) and i was already getting nervous about cancellation fees and planning and whatever. good thing i have an angel friend who came up with this solution for us and the husband is able to take his work with him this week and after a lot of practical shizzle, some tears, a last minute “i don’t think we should be doing this” and 10 gruelling hours in the car, we made it. so grateful to be able to do this, to be here. so ready to soak in every once of sunshine and nourishment and most of all so happy to have all these lovely people in my life \n\n#nourishment #mermaidlife",

    "description": "france really didn’t make sense to me while i was there. i had a plan and a vision and an idea and it was swept out from under me which is very aptly for this retrograde/coming into autumn season, or, you know, just life in general. i craved creative time and adventure and quality time with my love and most of all one final holiday of which i was sure i would feel okay enough for it to be worthwhile, or at least whatever version of worthwhile i have in my had. instead i got a stomach bug and days in pain and everything out of my controle. also sunshine. little treasures. time together in bed. lots of rest and time spent in bathtubs. not good for sure. not bad. neutral.\n\ncoming home i’m starting to see it more, what this trip was, or could be. while i am eating a burger with my love, both wrapped in blankets, dizzy from the shift from sunshine to rain. while i am cuddling the cats, who keep following me around whenever i go and have a lot of sniffing and head bumping and loving to do. while i am unpacking all the little treasure i seem to have gathered, unintentionally it seems, a bundle of lavender, some shells, a bundle of dried flowers, a rosebud. it’s an offering.\n\na monument. to the layers i have shed and the expectations that weren’t met. a monument of what was/is instead of what i want to be. a tribute to life, especially to what life feels like this moment\n\ni had expected coming home to be heavy, coming back to what is now truly autumn and life of a sick person and scans dooming up. but instead i feel ready, to life in this space, to sit here and let it come to me. we saw a dozen magpies on the way back home. there were packages waiting for me here,things i felt called to from past versions of me. new crystals, a book about astrology that was gifted to me and another, also an offering, on the way. the magic of retrogrades and solstices and life. that we don’t always get what we want, but will definitely get what we need\n\n#cyclicalliving #energymusings #mercuryretrograde #solstice #livinginthevoid #thisiswhatcancerlookslike #alsgodinfrankrijk #unplanning #soften #homing #ritual #offering #sacredspace #liminal #wanderer #travelgram #mermaid #magpie #oracle",

    "description": "summer to autumn has always been the hardest shift on my system, physically and mentally. being incurably ill has only made that more complicated since it really does affect me more, the cold and the dark make it a lot harder for me to take care of my body and to stay positive. \n\ni don’t know if the shift was very abrupt this time or if i was in denial and was living in an endless summer kind of vibe but the past few weeks have been very hard and i am feeling so unsettled as a result (also, autumn is a very airy/vata/floaty season so feeling unbalanced or ungrounded right now makes a lot of sense energetically). i’ve been floating around, keeping busy, feeling all sorts of cranky without looking at it too closely and today is the day i decided to pause and sit and assess the situation \n\ni’ve been writing this morning, or really, i’ve been reading a book and sending messages to a lot of people and distracting myself and writing in between all those things because sometimes that is the process that works. i’ve been musings about what i miss, what i long for, what i need right now. and out of all that rolled this.\n\nmy manifesto for this season. my wish/intention/proclamation/incantation: this autumn i will allow myself to live in a way that nourishes me\n\nso simple, so hard. i’ve made lists of all the things i love to do, all the things that inspire me. and i will lean into those things. a lot of it isn’t new or groundbreaking, in fact i think the only new thing on the list might be the painting with water colours which has been a plan for ages but it’s not something i ever actually did. the rest is a re invitation, of altar work and writing, of herbs and teas, of yoga, of tarot. leaning into the things that nourish me. today that looks like a cup of coffee with a lot of whipped cream in the sun. opening my journal after a month of barely any entries. baking a cake. some times grounding can be as simple as that, coming home after being adrift, making and eating good food, allowing in joy\n\n#autumnblues #sad #change #soften #nourishment #seaside #moonchild #cyclicalliving #slowlife #embodied #thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurableillness #sacredspace #selfcare",

    "description": "≘ musings about unlearning, cyclical living and resistance |pt1 ≘ \n\nthis is the pattern, my own circle of purgatory i can’t seem to escape from. i live a close to “normal” life and do all the things in a close to “normal” way and i convince myself of the fact that it is balanced and i am resting in between and i will be fine. then there is the crash, sometimes it’s after a day, sometimes after a week. my body is done with the too muchness of it all and reminds me of the fact that we are not 20 and we are not cancer free and this is not how we live our lives anymore. there is a lot of sleeping and scrolling. there are new books to read and cats that keep me company. depending on my mental state there is a little or a lot of feeling sorry for myself. sometimes it almost feels like a reprieve at first. after a few days i get bored and i want more and the first thing i always want is to write and then it can go two ways. \n\none option is me writing about all the things i want to do and the life i want to live and the fear that i will never be able to do it. it’s reflecting on how i’ve been here for 2years and my all or nothing mentality is still screwing me over and how i haven’t found a sustainable way to do what i want to do because i am stubborn and i want to do things in a certain way, the prime example here is alway how i only want to write and scrap in a cosy spot with a cup of tea and that i can’t/won’t do it half awake on the couch. \n\nthe second option is me coming up with a plan and/or a list of a selfcare container to help me stay positive and sane. it’s a list of more movement and meditation and trying to find activities to do in bed that aren’t involving a screen. i’ve written a version of said list/plan/manifesto a million times already. immediately after i’ve written it i won’t to tear it out because it is too much pressure and “have to” lists don’t work well for me. \n\n||| continued in the next post |||\n\n#cyclicalliving #thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurableillness #unlearning #soften #autumn #release #incurablecancer #shadowwork #musingsfromthevoid",

    "description": "≘ musings about unlearning, cyclical living and resistance |pt2 ≘\n\n||| part 1 in the previous post |||\n\nit’s a cyclical (now even more so) me stuck in a lineair world where lineair coping mechanisms such as lists and selfcare plans and detox days work. except they don’t,\nnot for me. because what i am actually doing here is unleaning all of that, the plans and the coping and the shoulds. what i am actually learning here is that i have always been in flux/shifting/in motion and now even more so. that there isn’t one set way to go about my day and that what i actually need most right now is to go with whatever is and listen to what my body and intuition tell me. it’s unlearning years of 9 to 5/capitalism/you are only worthy if you do something worthwhile. and then, even harder, it’s unlearning everything i ever learned and thought about selfcare and living in a body. it feels counterintuitive because it is taking down everything i ever thought was good and nourishing. it’s hard work because there isn’t a fixed plan or idea, every day is different and the rules keep changing. it’s exhausting. it makes me feel like i am doing everything wrong, like i should be trying more/better. it’s a transformative process that has been very painful and humbling and i’m very much still in the midst of it so there isn’t a near and tidy conclusion or take away that can wrap all of this up. and the point it that probably there will never be a near and tidy take away, this is messy, life is messy.\n\nps: these notes are ramblings from a dark-ish space, i know i’m okay and worthy, these are thoughts and musings that being chronically and incurably ill confront me with and writing about them helps me move through them \n\n#cyclicalliving #thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurableillness #unlearning #soften #autumn #release #incurablecancer #shadowwork #musingsfromthevoid #reflector #humandesignreflector",

    "description": "post oncologist blues (noun) - the 7 to 10 days after a big oncology appointment that are filled with big feelings, panic attacks, nightmares and annoyance \n\nthis is the part of the cycle i don’t hear a lot of other people talk about but is very prominent for me. it doesn’t matter wether it’s good or bad or neutral news, the week after a big appointment is always hell. i don’t know if it’s because of all the waiting and stress or because it’s  a very big reminder that yes you are sick and no we cannot fix it. \n\ni am having a very hard time this week and the whole autumn switch is making it just that tad bit spicier. i know this is part of the cycles and i am allowing myself to feel it all and hide away a bit more. sometimes healing is mostly allowing yourself to nap and knowing that you need this time to really process all the things that happened before you can feel more grounded and open again\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #cyclicalliving #eclipseportal",

    "description": "reminiscing and a little insta vs reality \n\nthe location was incredibly, magically gorgeous. it was my first time visiting zeeland and i completely fell in love driving through the landscape in the autumn sun, marvelling at the trees and all the water and we hadn’t even seen the sea yet by that point. the bnb was this gorgeous manor (which i called a castle in my mind) with deer running around the property, the room was an absolute dream and don’t even get me started on the bathtub. \n\ni was also dealing with  body that was struggling and praying that my digestion would start up again (it does that sometimes, not really work the way it is supposed to, it’s because of the scar tissue and the operations and the cancer) but this turned out to be a flu so i now know (still sitting in pjs recovering) that i hadn’t got a chance. i soldiered through on friday, going to the hotel as soon as possible to rest and enjoy the bath and each other’s company, hoping we would still be able to visit the sea and do some things the next day but overnight i only got worse and we had to leave saturday after breakfast (i didn’t have any but the hosts were so sweet and brought a whole table with delish things up for bram so he could stay with me while i was shivering and crying in bed)\n\nit’s the reality of planning things when you are chronically ill. there is all the planning and resting and hoping and praying but in the end there is always a chance our bodies won’t play ball and we won’t be able to do the things we want to do. it’s something i am learning to live with but also the thing that still hurts me most, being in the perfect spot with the perfect sunshine and the best company and not being able to enjoy it because i’m in pain or so exhausted. \n\non our drive back i was in so much pain and i was holding back tears and you held me hand and told me you enjoyed it anyway because we got to do it together and that’s very true. i am also still nourishing my soft little heart that is so sad for all the things i wanted but couldn’t \n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #instavsreality #travelgram #wanderer #mermaid #hotellife #visitzeeland #chronicillness #soften #embodied #sunrise #getaway",

    "description": "“does it sometimes bother you that you have to go to work everyday while get to sit her at home and watch tv and play with the cats?”\n\nas soon as the question is out i realise it had nothing to do with him and is something i have internalised somewhere, somehow. the swiftness of the answer makes it even more clear for me. because he sees that this is not a holiday or restful or restorative in any way. he realises that having to stay home and only having energy to put on a movie and nothing else is not a blessing but a curse.\n\nthese are stories i have picked up along the road, ever since i was born. takes that have been creeping under my skin for 31 years. that there is a good and a bad way to go about things. that your worth is derived from the things you do. that rest is something that should be earned.\n\ni had unpacked a lot of those things already, saw them for the lies that they are. and then the past 2 years came and i have been engulfed in it more than ever and i am working even harder on separating the facts from the stories, letting my reality and what that looks like sink in. god i would love to spend all day at home doing the things i love too, but truth is that’s not what i am doing. the caviat for that to be a joy is that it is only fun when it happens in a\nneutral body, one without pain or fatigue or restlessness. of course i have those days too but i guess people vastly overestimate how many neutral body days i get in a month, with the infusions and catching every cold there is, with the fatigue and the chronic pain, with the mental toll being incurably ill is taking. \n\ni am learning that rest is my day job now, that some days i like it and some days i despise it but however i feel about it won’t change the fact that that is what i have to do. i am learning to show myself grace here, in the midst of feeling not enough and lazy, that i can make things as cosy and as nourishing as possible and that it’s also important to feel the restlessness and the anger when i am derailed once again.\n\ni am learning to be here. if i would get a chance to choose i would pick going to work anytime over having to stay at home, being sick\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike",

    "description": "this is the best i’ve come up with when people ask me what micr.dosing feels like, you know that feeling after you have done a great breathwork session and meditated for like an hour and stretched your body and it’s a full moon and you are feeling inspired and connected and embodied and soft? it’s that but then without having to do all the work to get there\n\nmicr.dosing had been on my radar for a little while, i read an article about it, we saw “how to change your mind” (which is an excellent docu on netflix if you want to learn more about psilocybin and other plant medicine). then this summer it was all a bit too much and my scans showed my therapy wasn’t working as well anymore and i discussed it with my oncologist and we decided that i could give it a go to see if it could support my mental health before we’d turn to anti depressants. an hour later i was already browsing the @return.to.the.sun website, a week later i took my first dose and the change was immediate.\n\ni’m so grateful micr.dosing crossed my path when it did, i was hitting a very though rock bottom and the medicine really helped me to soften into that, to allow the feelings and the fears and the restlessness and then help to transform it. \n\nit helped me feel safe. in my body. in the situation i was in. it helped me realise that i could be a safe space.\n\ni’m still trying to figure out the perfect schedule and dosage but micr.dosing now is a staple in my self- and healthcare. i love incorporating it into my rituals, infusing it with reiki and intentions. it’s something i know i can fall back on when everything starts to feel too heavy and intense. it has been a tremendous help to soften the panic attacks and dissociating i was struggling with and i really like how, unlike for example xanax, it doesn’t make me feel out of it or woozy, on the contrary, i feel more awake, more myself.\n\nthe wonderful people at @return.to.the.sun have been so kind to offer us a discount code, you can use “maxime10” to get 10% off your order\n\n#soften #healing #mentalhealth #panicattacks #grounded #embodied #herbalhealth #intuitiveliving #supportsystem #sacredspace #selfcare #intuition",

    "description": "we know this and still when it happens it comes as such a shock. life can change so fast. everything can shift so fast. even for a person like me who has everything upside down to begin with and knows that change is the only thing she can count on. \n\nin times of stability, we kind of forget.. thank god.. our bodies and brains and hearts can’t thrive in chaos, they can’t live in it. so somehow we learn how to live alongside it. alongside the pain and trauma and bad news. alongside hard truths and fatigue and grief. we kindle a fire of hope and beauty and gratitude and somehow - not because we are strong or brave, but because we are human - we live through it all\n\nthe contrast couldn’t be more huge, our england trip really felt like a rebirth for me, a reconnection to myself and my body and my energy. i felt awakened and inspired, like i had been granted some air after week after week of suffocation. and then the morning after we came home i had to go to the er and what i was sure would be a kidney stone wasn’t one and now everything is scary and on hold. i have an mri this weekend and then next week we’ll know more. \n\nso here we are, hanging on again, trying to let the reality of the situation and our hope for it live next to each other. what i way to embark on our chariot year \n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurablebowelcancer #musingsfromthevoid #waitinggame #chariotyear",

    "description": "𓊓 a story i want to tell that gives me hope living in the void 𓊓\n\ntwo years ago i was in kind of the same situation as i’m in right now. to sketch the scene: i had gotten diagnose with bowel cancer and mets to both ovaries in oktober 2020, was in immense pain and could barely keep food down and they scheduled an emergency situation (a hipec, which i later learned is one of the hardest ops you can go through). back then we were still very much working on curing me and i was put on a maintenance chemo (folfox) in the middle of december. fast forward to the beginning of february, 3 rounds in, and i was in immense pain, having all the side effects, overal miserable and having a very bad feeling about the chemo. an er visit led to a scan which led to the words “we can see something off at your bowel but we can’t tell if it’s just an infection or recurrence we will need an mri”. (if any of this sounds familiar it’s because it is familiar). a week later we learned that my cancer had returned and the chemo wasn’t working and we had to pivot and that’s how i got put on the immuno therapy(encorafenib + cetuximab) that i have been stable on for two years now.\n\ni was terrified, there were no guarantees, this might be the tipping point. the only saving grace was that immuno therapy would normally mean a lot less side effects. i would have never hoped for one med to stop working, i would have never hoped for a recurrence, i would have never hoped for the “we don’t know but we can try”. i didn’t know it back then because it felt like everything was swept from under me but it was a true blessing. the immunotherapy worked, first it shrunk my tumor and then everything stayed stable. also, the side effects were much more manegeable. i had been surviving under my chemo regime but immuno gave me the possibility to start living again. i got to do so many things because of this therapy, i got two years of life. \n\nit was a true tower moment where something was falling away for something better but i would never have let the security of what i knew, go on my own so i needed some help. \n\ncontinued in pictures\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurableillness #livinginthevoid #bowelcancer",

    "description": "𓊓 a story i want to tell that gives me hope living in the void 𓊓\n\ntwo years ago i was in kind of the same situation as i’m in right now. to sketch the scene: i had gotten diagnose with bowel cancer and mets to both ovaries in oktober 2020, was in immense pain and could barely keep food down and they scheduled an emergency situation (a hipec, which i later learned is one of the hardest ops you can go through). back then we were still very much working on curing me and i was put on a maintenance chemo (folfox) in the middle of december. fast forward to the beginning of february, 3 rounds in, and i was in immense pain, having all the side effects, overal miserable and having a very bad feeling about the chemo. an er visit led to a scan which led to the words “we can see something off at your bowel but we can’t tell if it’s just an infection or recurrence we will need an mri”. (if any of this sounds familiar it’s because it is familiar). a week later we learned that my cancer had returned and the chemo wasn’t working and we had to pivot and that’s how i got put on the immuno therapy(encorafenib + cetuximab) that i have been stable on for two years now.\n\ni was terrified, there were no guarantees, this might be the tipping point. the only saving grace was that immuno therapy would normally mean a lot less side effects. i would have never hoped for one med to stop working, i would have never hoped for a recurrence, i would have never hoped for the “we don’t know but we can try”. i didn’t know it back then because it felt like everything was swept from under me but it was a true blessing. the immunotherapy worked, first it shrunk my tumor and then everything stayed stable. also, the side effects were much more manegeable. i had been surviving under my chemo regime but immuno gave me the possibility to start living again. i got to do so many things because of this therapy, i got two years of life. \n\nit was a true tower moment where something was falling away for something better but i would never have let the security of what i knew, go on my own so i needed some help. \n\ncontinued in pictures\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurableillness #livinginthevoid #bowelcancer",

    "description": "i have known fear in a lot of different ways the past 2 years and a half. the fear of a body that is slowly shutting down and no one that can tell you what is wrong. the fear of an operation they can’t tell you what they will be able to until they are in the middle of it. the fear of starting chemo. the fear (and reality) of recurrence. the fear of having to stop chemo and trust in a new, experimental drug. \n\nthe fear now is part fear of the unknown but mostly fear of the things i do know. the fear of getting sicker, weaker. of being in more pain. of not having a lot of options left. before it was all these things i didn’t really know or couldn’t imagine and now i am afraid of things i do know. of how i spent 2 year building my body and my mind back up, learning to live again and now i might have to learn to die all over. the fear of a new medicine and what comes with that. the fear of losing myself all over again. sometimes the knows is much scarier than the unknown could ever be\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #musingsfromthevoid #fear #bowelcancer #brafmutation #incurableillness #soften",

    "description": "museum of lost fragments\n\nthe latest installation in “things cancer has stolen from me”. this one is a particularly hard one. it’s linked to more trauma and various iterations of me share this specific pain. it’s also something i cannot hide away under a good sweater and smart pants. not looking sick has been both a sense of pride and a sore spot. i’ve learned to love this body through a lot of things these past years, learned to be neutral about a lot more of those things (body neutrality is a very interesting concept for those having a body that is hard to love for whatever reason, @bethanycmeyers is a lovely resource to start exploring this)\n\nthis morning was a particularly hard one, a moment of “this too, i am honestly not sure how i can even start to carry this as well”. i’ve been avoiding mirrors, avoiding going out, taking pictures. i normally send a lot of videos as a way of talking to friends when i’m too lazy to type and haven’t done any of that since my skin started to get angry and inflamed. \n\nmy first step into neutrality comes, of course, in the form of selfportraits. while i was at it i decided to document my whole museum, all the layers of me that i have loved and lost and grieved (the ones that are outwardly apparent that is). some of these took no time to get used to, i’ve always been chill about my huge scar. the stomas were very very very hard and continue to be but i have found some kind of peace there, like a truce. finding good underwear and bathing suits have helped for that, realising that no one has to know unless i want them to as well. my port is honestly a work of art, even though i don’t like that they had to make two incisions. the burn marks from the hot water bottles around my back and sides are whatever. so here you go, this is my museum, thank you for joining the tour\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #bowelcancer #bodyneutrality #embodied #selfportrait",

    "description": "the closer it comes, the more i realise that, despite what i told myself, letting go is going to be a messy experience for me (how did i even ever expect that to go any other way?)\n\ni somehow told myself the story that i was a letting go pro despite all the evidence in my life pointing to the contrary. what i am finding in return is flexibility of a kind. i’ve been saying for months now that i won’t ever go back on chemo, that it might be for others but not for me again. i fought against it with all my might but now i ended up in the situation where it is the only thing i have left, after immuno failed and the trial isn’t having any effect and cancer is growing. my body feels like a mine field. my body doesn’t feel mine.\n\ni am so tired. bone tired. an exhausted that’s etched in the hollow under my eyes. tired of being in so much pain. of being able to do so little. tired enough that letting go seems like a legit and valid option at this point. somehow i am also planning on starting a new chemo regime next week..\n\ni don’t think that it’s brave or even that it speaks of hope. it speaks volumes of fear and too little time and too little good days. letting go is proving to be harder than i thought it would be yet i also knew that talking about this point and being at it would be two different things entirely. \n\nthese are real things and valid things and things we should talk about. sometimes i get these messages that tell me they “wish me the strength to keep going” and then i always wonder, but who is going to offer me the strength and clarity to know when to let go?\n\nsometimes you just can’t keep going and that is real too, not quitting like some narratives would like us to believe. this whole post is a love letter to knowing when to let go and that sometimes the only thing more impossible than stopping is to continue on. so here is to holding on, and letting go\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurableillness #bowelcancer #braf #lettinggo #soften #folfiri",

    "description": "there have been so many changes i have had to wrap my head around this last few weeks, it’s hard to even remember what life was like before it all started to go downhill very very fast. for the past few weeks i’ve mostly been in survival/soldier on/fake it till you make it mode and there hasn’t been a lot of time to let things sink in or really take a moment to sit with all of it (also i desperately didn’t want to stand still). \n\nthings are kind of slowing down right now, a new reality is setting in and let me tell you i am having a very hard time with it. it doesn’t matter that i knew this would come at some point, somehow i am still baffled and confused as to how we got to this point.\n\ni feel hurt and lost and scared and angry and upset and numb and exhausted and annoyed. that’s a lot of feelings to handle let alone in a body that’s trying to digest it’s first chemo session.\n\npeople keep asking me if i’m okay and the short answer is “i guess so” since i am here and breathing and taking care of myself as best as i know how. the long answer is.. complicated. i always thought there’d be more time. i’m feeling very lost in this new version of my body and my mind. i hardly recognise parts of myself and i am struggling to keep moving, to keep doing things because i keep questioning the why of it. \n\nthese past years i’ve fought so hard to find a way to live a meaningful and soft life while sick and just when it felt i finally felt like i got the hang of it, things come crashing down again. i guess that’s life for you, right now it just feels like i’m in a crash course version of it and the waves aren’t letting up and i can’t help but wonder how i am going to carry all these things while it already felt so heavy, i already felt so exhausted. right now i really don’t see it and that okay as well, i’m taking time to feel all the feels and grief all the new losses\n\n(ps lots has shifted in this year so i made a little recap in the “cancer update” story highlight in case you feel like you missed part of the story)\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #incurableillness #livinginthevoid #changes #towermoments #embodied #soften #bowelcancer #feelingitall #grief #chemolife #folfiri",

    "description": "the scent of summer heat in the early morning. home made iced latte with whipped cream. italian cookies that are even better because they have been in the sun. the way this floaty jumpsuit makes me feel. feet in the kiddy pool. the light making everything extra gorgeous. new, super pigmented eyeshadow. texting with friends. bram asleep on the grass. paella for lunch. taking a million photographs.\n\nthis is an antidote.\nthis is proof that i am alive. that there is beauty here. that joy is accessible. they this life is worth living. that i can still create.\n\nthis is how i learn to feel safe again.\nafter a day spent in the hospital at the mercy of others. \n\nthis is how i reclaim my body. make her into more than just her stats and broken parts.\n\nthis is the softest rebellion.\n\n#thisiswhatcancerlookslike #livinginthevoid #soften #embodied #summerdays #nourishment #sunsoaking #selfcare #bowelcancer #gardenlife #sacredspace",

    "description": "living in the void | chemo tales\n\nmy first cycle of folfiri felt like a breeze. yes i was was sick, yes i was tired but i had a chemo experience two years ago that left me traumatised and weary and compared to that, this was a walk in the park-ish. what also contributed to it was the fact that i was so sick before starting chemo. “hadn’t eaten in two weeks, really starting to think this is the end”kind of sick. everything better than that is an improvement and i took it with both hands and i tried to be brave.\n\nfrom then on things started to get wobbly. i’ve spent every chemo cycle at the er at least once, there was the time with the 10dagen hospital stay for an infection and the time with the never ending diarrhoea and then next cycle (cycle 5) there was the rock bottom. \n\ni think i spent about 80% of my time in bed that cycle (at least when i wasn’t on the toilet), the pain and the fatigue just kept dragging and there are days i don’t even really remember because i was so out of it. mentally i was sinning as well, and rapidly. \n\nit’s hard doing chemo without an end point in sight (i mean there is an endpoint but that’s me dying so that’s not really a tempting countdown), it’s hard hyping yourself up time and time again when you know how ill you’ll be, how much your lill body’s will suffer, how little you can do. \n\ni’m very happy i got to talk to some people who reminded my that i was in charge and no one can force me to do chemo, so i asked for two weeks off and i am so grateful i did. \n\nin true ironic maxie fashion (because do things ever go the way i plan them to, really?)my back decided to collapse on me the day after so i’ve spent all that time in enormous amounts of pain, immobile, sad,\nin bed and i honestly don’t know how much if this i can take anymore. my break turned into a torture chamber though i am still very grateful i am not doing chemo together with all of this, it still feels like someone stole my time off from me. instead of recuperating i can feel myself sinking deeper and deeper. wishing for a real break soon!\n\n#chemolife #thisiswhatcancerlookslike #musingsfromthevoid #bowelcancer #embodied #soften #rest #recovery",

    "description": "if there is one thing i have been praying/hoping/aching for (except some time to recuperate, you can’t look at any of my post and not noticing how desperate i am for some time and softness), it’s support. i already have a lot of good, solid, kind people surrounding me but i’ve been subtly and not so subtly asking the universe for extra support without actually truly knowing what i am searching for. that’s okay though because that works better for me than having a clear image, it makes me able to see thing i otherwise would have missed\n\ni thought i was searching for a mentor or teacher, and definitely a (death) doula but i found some other people on my path these last few weeks that are all of that and less and more\n\nthe troops are assembling and it feels strangely comforting and scary at the same time. i never needed troops the way i need them right now, and especially in the way i know i will need them in the next phases. it feels good to be prepared, to be surrounded, to know that there is solid support and knowledge and love. it feels healing to know that there is still time to have the talks and create a plan to make sure i can do these next phases as much as maxie as i can, to share with people what feels important right now and have them help advocate for me\n\nlast week i had my first meeting with panal (a palliative care team that works in my neighbourhood) and i was really scared, scared that it might be too heavy or too soon or that i might jinx things. and then this fairy of a person walked in and she is going to be the one to help advocate for me. she feels like all the things i have been waiting and asking for, an extra cheerleader, a potential new friend even, someone to hold my hand while we walk this path. here is the thing about palliative care, people tend to live longer while on it. it might seem scary at first but for me it’s a breath of fresh air, to have the emphasis shift on quality of life (also this doesn’t mean that i might not at some point still start chemo again or enter a trial) #continued in comments#",

    "description": "Part 2 - i wanted to part with some words of wisdom or whatever so fittingly this will be my last gentle reminder. \n\nwe need your kind of magic in this world. whatever it is, whatever that looks like. even more so when it doesn’t look or feel like magic or anything special to you! when you feel like you don’t really have a talent or anything important to offer to the world, this message is even more important and very sneakkily especially meant for you. i can see your magic. i know, feel, swear that you are making a difference in this world just by being in it. please continue to shine your light.\n\nplease be gentle with yourself. the world is so hard and life can be heavy and a lot and the times are really really transformative (which we all know is just a nice word for f*cking hard). show yourself grace and kindness through all this. allow yourself to feel and rest and have bad days. become an expert in taking care of yourself, knowing the signs of your body when you need some extra down time, knowing what gives you energy and what inspired you. \n\nplease lean in and listen to the little voice inside of you and follow their call and directions. you know. you really do. everything is already in you, that’s not the work you have to do here. the work is allowing yourself to listen to it. making sure it feels safe to follow the little whispers that make absolutely no sense at the moment but will in time. this is the most important job you have here, allowing yourself to lean into what you already know and follow it and making it feel as safe and easy as possible.",
